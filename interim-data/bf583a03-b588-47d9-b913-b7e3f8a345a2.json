This enables you to preview the sent message in the different contexts in which it may be received and check the compatibility in major desktops and applications.\n\n>[!CAUTION]\n>Inbox rendering is not compatible with [recurring deliveries](communication-channels.md#recurring-delivery).\n>\n\nLitmus is a feature-rich email validation and previewing application. It allows email content creators to preview their message content in over 70 email renderers, such as the Gmail inbox or the Apple Mail client.\n\nThe mobile, messaging and webmail clients available for **Inbox rendering** in Adobe Campaign are listed on the [Litmus website](https://litmus.com/email-testing) (click **View all email clients**).\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>Inbox rendering is not necessary to test personalization in deliveries. Personalization can be checked with Adobe Campaign tools such as **[!UICONTROL Preview]** and [Proofs](steps-validating-the-delivery.md#sending-a-proof).\n\n## Activating Inbox rendering {#activating-inbox-rendering}\n\n[!BADGE On-premise & Hybrid]{type=Caution url=\"https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/installing-campaign-classic/architecture-and-hosting-models/hosting-models-lp/hosting-models.html\" tooltip=\"Applies to on-premise and hybrid deployments only\"}\n\nFor hosted and hybrid clients, Inbox rendering is configured on your instance by Adobe technical support and consultants. For more information, contact your Adobe Account executive.\n\nFor on-premise installations, follow the steps below to configure Inbox rendering.\n\n1. Install the **[!UICONTROL Inbox rendering (IR)]** package via the **[!UICONTROL Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Advanced]** > **[!UICONTROL Import package]** menu. For more on this, see [Installing Campaign Classic standard packages](../../installation/using/installing-campaign-standard-packages.md).\n1. Configure an external account of the HTTP type via the **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Platform]** > **[!UICONTROL External Accounts]** node. For more on this, see [Creating an external account](../../installation/using/external-accounts.md#creating-an-external-account).\n1. Set the external account parameters as follows:\n    * **[!UICONTROL Label]**: Deliverability server info\n    * **[!UICONTROL Internal name]**: deliverabilityInstance\n    * **[!UICONTROL Type]**: HTTP\n    * **[!UICONTROL Server]**: https://deliverability-app.neolane.net/deliverability\n    * **[!UICONTROL Encryption]**: None\n    * Check the **[!UICONTROL Enabled]** option.\n    \n    ![](assets/s_tn_inbox_rendering_external-account.png)\n \n1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Platform]** > **[!UICONTROL Options]** node. Search for the **[!UICONTROL DmRendering_cuid]** option and contact support to get your delivery reports identifier that needs to be copied to the **[!UICONTROL Value (text)]** field.\n1. Edit the **serverConf.xml** file to allow a call to the Litmus server. Add the following line to the `<urlPermission>` section:\n\n    ```\n    <url dnsSuffix=\"deliverability-app.neolane.net\" urlRegEx=\"https://.*\"/>\n    ```\n\n1. Reload the configuration using the following command:\n\n   ```\n   nlserver config -reload\n   ```\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>You may have to log out from the console and log back in to be able to use Inbox rendering.\n\n## About Litmus tokens {#about-litmus-tokens}\n\nAs Litmus is a third-party service, it works on a credit-per-usage model. Each time a user calls on the Litmus functionality, credit is deducted.\n\nIn Adobe Campaign, the credit corresponds to the number of available renderings (known as tokens).\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>The number of Litmus tokens available depends on the Campaign license that you purchased. Check your license agreement.\n\nEach time you use the **[!UICONTROL Inbox rendering]** feature in a delivery, each rendering generated decreases your available tokens by one.\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n>\n>Tokens account for each individual rendering and not for the whole Inbox rendering report, meaning that:  \n>\n>* Each time the Inbox rendering report is generated, one token per messaging client is deducted: one token for the Outlook 2000 rendering, one for the Outlook 2010 rendering, one for the Apple Mail 9 rendering, and so on.\n>* For the same delivery, if you generate the Inbox rendering again, the number of available tokens is again decreased by the number of generated renderings.\n>\n\nThe number of remaining available tokens is displayed in the **[!UICONTROL General summary]** of the [Inbox rendering report](#inbox-rendering-report).\n\n![](assets/s_tn_inbox_rendering_tokens.png)\n\nTypically, the Inbox rendering feature is used to test the HTML framework of a newly designed email. Each rendering requires approximately up to 70 tokens (depending on the number of environments generally tested on). However, in some cases you may require multiple inbox rendering reports to fully test your delivery. It could therefore take more tokens to complete several checks.\n\n## Accessing the inbox rendering report {#accessing-the-inbox-rendering-report}\n\nOnce you have created your email delivery and defined its content as well as the targeted population, follow the steps below.\n\nFor more on creating, designing and targeting a delivery, refer to [this section](about-email-channel.md).\n\n1. On the top bar of the delivery, click the **[!UICONTROL Inbox rendering]** button.\n1. Select **[!UICONTROL Analyze]** to start the capture process.\n\n   ![](assets/s_tn_inbox_rendering_button.png)\n\n   A proof is sent. The rendering thumbnails can be accessed in that proof a few minutes after sending the emails. For more on sending proofs, refer to [this section](steps-validating-the-delivery.md#sending-a-proof).\n\n1. After being sent, the proof appears in the delivery list. Double-click it.\n\n   ![](assets/s_tn_inbox_rendering_delivery_list.png)\n\n1. Go to the **Inbox Rendering** tab of the proof.\n\n   ![](assets/s_tn_inbox_rendering_tab.png)\n\n   The Inbox rendering report is displayed.\n\n## Inbox rendering report {#inbox-rendering-report}\n\nThis report displays the inbox renderings as they appear to the recipient. The renderings can differ based upon how the recipient opens the email delivery: in a browser, on a mobile device, or via an email application.\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL General summary]** presents the number of messages received, unwanted (spam), not received, or pending reception, as a list and through a graphical color-coded representation.\n\n![](assets/s_tn_inbox_rendering_summary.png)\n\nHover over the chart to display the details for each color.\n\nThe body of the report is divided into three parts: **[!UICONTROL Mobile]**, **[!UICONTROL Messaging clients]**, and **[!UICONTROL Webmails]**. Scroll down the report to display all the renderings grouped into these three categories.\n\n![](assets/s_tn_inbox_rendering_report.png)\n\nTo get the details for each report, click the corresponding card. The rendering is displayed for the reception method selected.\n\n![](assets/s_tn_inbox_rendering_example.png)\n","headers":[["title","Inbox rendering in Campaign"],["description","Learn how to capture email renderings and make them available in a dedicated report"],["feature","Inbox Rendering, Monitoring, Email Rendering"]],"sections":[{"section":"Inbox rendering","sectionId":"4e3e3473-4d60-441b-85a9-ae8bd7adf59f","paragraphs":[]},{"section":"About inbox rendering","sectionId":"de98c742-fbcc-4766-92b8-10907250ff61","paragraphs":["Before hitting the Send button, make sure that your message will be displayed to the recipients in an optimal way on a variety of web clients, web mails and devices.","To allow this, Adobe Campaign leverages the Litmus web-based email testing solution to capture the renderings and make them available in a dedicated report.
