This field will generate an additional column in the data preview window. This column will specify the numeric values returned as a result for each recipient (0, 1 and 2). A gender will be assigned to each value in the new column: \"Male\" for \"1\", \"Female\" for \"2\" or \"Not indicated\" if the value equals \"0\".\n\n* Which table needs to be selected?\n\n  The recipient table (nms:recipient)\n\n* Fields to be selected in the output column?\n\n  Last name, First name, Gender\n\n* Criteria which the information will be filtered based on?\n\n  The rrecipient language\n\nApply the following steps:\n\n1. Open the Generic query editor and select the Recipient table (**[!UICONTROL nms:recipient]**).\n1. In the **[!UICONTROL Data to extract]** window, select **[!UICONTROL Last name]**, **[!UICONTROL First name]** and **[!UICONTROL Gender]**.\n\n   ![](assets/query_editor_nveau_73.png)\n\n1. In the **[!UICONTROL Sorting]** window, click **[!UICONTROL Next]**: no sort is necessary for this example.\n1. In **[!UICONTROL Data filtering]**, select **[!UICONTROL Filtering conditions]**.\n1. In the **[!UICONTROL Target element]** window, set a filter condition to collect recipients who speak English.\n\n   ![](assets/query_editor_nveau_74.png)\n\n1. In the **[!UICONTROL Data formatting]** window, click **[!UICONTROL Add a calculated field]**.\n\n   ![](assets/query_editor_nveau_75.png)\n\n1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Type]** window of the **[!UICONTROL Export calculated field definition]** window and select **[!UICONTROL Enumerations]**.\n\n   Define the column which the new calculated field must refer to. To do this, select the **[!UICONTROL Gender]** column in the drop-down menu of the **[!UICONTROL Source column]** field: the destination values will coincide with the **[!UICONTROL Gender]** column.\n\n   ![](assets/query_editor_nveau_76.png)\n\n   Define the **Source** and **Destination** values: the destination value makes the query result easier to read. This query should return recipient gender and the result will either be 0, 1, or 2.\n\n   For each \"source-destination\" line to be entered, click **[!UICONTROL Add]** in the **[!UICONTROL List of enumeration values]**:\n\n    * In the **[!UICONTROL Source]** column, enter the source value for each gender (0,1,2) in a new line.\n    * In the **[!UICONTROL Destination]** column, enter the values: \"Not indicated\" for line \"0\", \"Male\" for line \"1\", and \"Female\" for line \"2\".\n\n   Select the **[!UICONTROL Keep the source value]** function.\n\n   Click **[!UICONTROL OK]** to approve the calculated field.\n\n   ![](assets/query_editor_nveau_77.png)\n\n1. In the **[!UICONTROL Data formatting]** window, click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.\n1. In the preview window, **[!UICONTROL start the preview of the data]**.\n\n   The additional column defines the gender of 0, 1 and 2:\n\n    * 0 for \"Not indicated\"\n    * 1 for \"Male\"\n    * 2 for \"Female\"\n\n   ![](assets/query_editor_nveau_78.png)\n\n   For example, if you don't enter gender \"2\" in the **[!UICONTROL List of enumeration values]**, and the **[!UICONTROL Generate a warning and continue]** function of the **[!UICONTROL In other cases]** field is selected, you will get a warning log. This log indicates that gender \"2\" (Female) has not been entered. It is displayed in the **[!UICONTROL Logs generated during export]** field of the data preview window.\n\n   ![](assets/query_editor_nveau_79.png)\n\n   Let's take another example and say that enumeration value \"2\" isn't entered. Select the **[!UICONTROL Generate an error and reject the line]** function: all gender \"2\" recipients will raise anomalies and the other information in the line (first and last name, etc.) will not be exported. An error log is displayed in the **[!UICONTROL Logs generated during export]** field of the data preview window. This log indicates that enumeration value \"2\" isn't entered.\n\n   ![](assets/query_editor_nveau_80.png)\n","headers":[["title","Add an Enumeration type calculated field"],["description","Learn how to add an Enumeration type calculated field"],["topic-tags","use-cases"],["feature","Workflows, Data Management"]],"sections":[{"section":"Add an Enumeration type calculated field","sectionId":"f3744fce-9554-4866-b9f9-b437c3ff45be","paragraphs":["Here we want to create a query with an Enumerations type calculated field.
