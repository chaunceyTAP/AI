For Adobe IMS authentication, refer to [this documentation](https://helpx.adobe.com/ie/manage-account/using/change-or-reset-password.html){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nTo reset a Campaign password, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Connect via an operator with administrator rights.\n1. Right-click an operator.\n1. Select **[!UICONTROL Actions]** > **[!UICONTROL Reset password]**.\n\n   ![](assets/operator-passwd.png)\n\n1. Set the operator's new password.

Edit the **/usr/local/neolane/nl6/conf/serverConf.xml** file.\n\n1. Go to the **internalPassword** line.\n\n    ```xml\n    <!-- XTK authentication mode internalPassword : Password of internal account -->\n    <xtk internalPassword=\"myPassword\"/>\n    ```\n\n1. Delete the string in quotes, in this case: `myPassword`. You get the following line:\n\n    ```xml\n    <!-- XTK authentication mode internalPassword : Password of internal account -->\n    <xtk internalPassword=\"\"/>\n    ```\n\n1. Save changes and close the file.\n\n1. Stop the `nlserver` process.\n\n1. Configure the new password. To do this, enter the following commands:\n\n    ```javascript\n    nlserver config -internalpassword\n    HH:MM:SS > Application server for Adobe Campaign Classic (7.X YY.R build XXX@SHA1) of DD/MM/YYYY\n    Enter current password.\n    Password: (empty)\n    Enter the new password.\n    Password: \n    Confirmation \n    ```\n\n1.
