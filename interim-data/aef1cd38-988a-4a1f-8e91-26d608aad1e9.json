This elements must include the \"@type=link\" attribute.\n* XML `<element>`  : defines a Text type \"mData\" field. This element must include the \"@type=xml\" attribute.\n\n## Attribute description {#attribute-description-4}\n\n* **_operation (string)**: defines the type of writing in the database.\n\n  This attribute is mainly used when extending out-of-the-box schemas.\n\n  Accessible values are:\n\n  * \"none\": reconciliation alone.

This way, it's possible to display a link as a local field and change it behavior during a query. When the element is found in the SELECT of a query, the value of the link target will be used. When the element is found in the WHERE of a query, the underlying key of the link will be used. \n* **edit (string)**: this attribute specifies the type of input that will be used in the form linked to the schema.\n* **enum (string)**: receives the name of the enumeration linked to the field.

The value of the \"@name\" attribute must be short, preferably in English, and comply with naming constraints linked to XML.\n\n  When the schema is written to the database, prefixes are automatically added to the field name by Adobe Campaign.\n\n  * \"i\": prefix for the 'integer' type.\n  * \"d\": prefix for the 'double' type.\n  * \"s\": prefix for the character string type.\n  * \"ts\": prefix for the 'date' type.\n\n  To define the name of the table in an autonomous way, you need to use the \"@sqltable\" attribute in the definition of the main schema element.\n\n* **noDbIndex (boolean)**: lets you specify that the element will not be indexed.\n* **ordered (boolean)**: if the attribute is activated (ordered=\"true\"), Adobe Campaign keeps the element declaration sequence in an XML collection element.\n* **pkSequence (string)**: receives the name of the sequence to be used for calculating an auto-incremental key.

The definition isn't copied into the current schema.\n* **required (boolean)**: if this attribute is activated (@required=\"true\"), the field is highlighted in the interface. The label of the field will be red in forms. \n* **revAdvanced (boolean)**: when activated, this attribute specifies that the opposite link is an \"advanced\" link. \n* **revCardinality (string)**: this attribute defines the cardinality of a link between two tables. It is used in a \"link\" type `<element>`.\n\n  Possible values are:\n\n  * \"single\" : Simple 1-1 type link\n  * \"unbound\": 1-N type collection link\n\n  By default, if the attribute isn't specified during link creation, cardinality will be 1-N.\n\n* **revDesc (string)**: this attribute receives a description linked to the opposite link.\n* **revExternalJoin (boolean)**: when activated, this attribute lets you force the external join on the opposite link. \n* **revIntegrity (string)**: this attribute defines the integrity on the target schema.
