Identify the pages you wish to track and determine their type (WEB or TRANSACTION).\n1. Determine which additional information you wish to collect, and extend the **nms:webTrackingLog** schema with the description of this information. By default, this schema can store the transaction amounts and number of items per transaction.\n1. Creating the web tracking tags. There are two ways of doing this:\n\n    * Insert the URLs corresponding to these pages in your Adobe Campaign platform, then generate and extract the associated web-tracking tags (from the **[!UICONTROL Campaign execution>Resources>Web tracking tags]** node of the client console). \n    * Create the web-tracking tags yourself in \"on-the-fly creation\" mode: the URLs corresponding to these pages will be automatically inserted in your Adobe Campaign platform.\n\n1.
