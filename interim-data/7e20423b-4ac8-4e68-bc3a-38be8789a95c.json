Profiles shared by the main set and at least one of the entry activities will be excluded.\n\n![](assets/s_user_segmentation_exclu.png)\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>For more on configuring and using the exclusion activity, refer to [Excluding a population (Exclusion)](targeting-data.md#excluding-a-population--exclusion-).\n\nCheck the **[!UICONTROL Generate complement]** option if you wish to exploit the remaining population.

Insert and open an **[!UICONTROL Exclusion]** -type activity following two queries. The first query targets recipients living in Paris. The second query targets those aged 18 to 30.\n1. Enter the main set. Here the main set is the **18-30 years old** query. Elements pertaining to the second set will be excluded from the final result.\n1. Check the **[!UICONTROL Generate complement]** option if you wish to exploit the data that remains after the exclusion. In this case, the complement is made up of recipients aged 18 to 30 that live in Paris.\n1. Approve the exclusion configuration then insert an update list activity to the result. You can also insert an additional list update to the complement where necessary.\n1. Execute the workflow.
