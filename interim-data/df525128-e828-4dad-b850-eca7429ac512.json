Create a new delivery mapping and choose the targeting dimension, the schema you just created, for example.\n\n   ![](assets/wf_new_mapping_create_fda.png)\n\n1. Indicate the fields where the delivery information is stored (last name, first name, email, address, etc.).\n\n   ![](assets/wf_new_mapping_define_join.png)\n\n1. Specify the parameters for information storage, including the suffix of the extension schemas in order for them to be easily identifiable.\n\n   ![](assets/wf_new_mapping_define_names.png)\n\n   You can choose whether to store exclusions (**excludelog**), with messages (**broadlog**) or in a separate table.\n\n   You can also choose whether to manage tracking for this delivery mapping (**trackinglog**).\n\n1.
