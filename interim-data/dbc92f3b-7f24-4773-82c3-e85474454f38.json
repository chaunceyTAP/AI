The calculation of the key value depends on a sequence (by default, the **XtkNewId** SQL function) generating a number that is unique in the entire database. The content of the key is automatically entered on insertion of the record.\n\nThe advantage of an incremental key is that it provides a non-modifiable technical key for the joins between tables. In addition, this key does not occupy much memory because it uses a double-byte integer.\n\nYou can specify in the source schema the name of the sequence to be used with the **pkSequence** attribute. If this attribute is not given in the source schema, the **XtkNewId** default sequence will be used. The application uses dedicated sequences for the **nms:broadLog** and **nms:trackingLog** schemas (**NmsBroadLogId** and **NmsTrackingLogId** respectively) because these are the tables that contain the most records.\n\nFrom ACC 18.10, **XtkNewId** is no more the default value for the sequence in the out-of-the-box schemas. You are now able to build schema or to extend existing schema with a dedicated sequence.\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n>\n>When creating a new schema or during a schema extension, you need to keep the same primary key sequence value (@pkSequence) for the whole schema.\n\nA sequence referenced in an Adobe Campaign schema (**NmsTrackingLogId** for example) must be associated with an SQL function that returns the number of IDs in the parameters, separated by commas. This function must be called **GetNew**XXX**Ids**, where **XXX** is the name of the sequence (**GetNewNmsTrackingLogIds** for example). View the **postgres-nms.sql**, **mssql-nms.sql** or **oracle-nms.sql** files provided with the application in the **datakit/nms/eng/sql/** directory to recover the example of a 'NmsTrackingLogId' sequence creation for each database engine.\n\nTo declare a unique key, populate the **autopk** attribute (with value \"true\") on the main element of the data schema.\n\n**Example**:\n\nDeclaring an incremental key in the source schema:\n\n```sql\n<srcSchema name=\"recipient\" namespace=\"cus\">\n  <element name=\"recipient\" autopk=\"true\">\n  ...\n  </element>\n</srcSchema>\n```\n\nThe schema generated:\n\n```sql\n<schema mappingType=\"sql\" name=\"recipient\" namespace=\"cus\" xtkschema=\"xtk:schema\">  \n  <element name=\"recipient\" autopk=\"true\" pkSequence=\"XtkNewId\" sqltable=\"CusRecipient\"> \n    <dbindex name=\"id\" unique=\"true\">\n      <keyfield xpath=\"@id\"/>\n    </dbindex>\n\n    <key internal=\"true\" name=\"id\">\n      <keyfield xpath=\"@id\"/>\n    </key>\n\n    <attribute desc=\"Internal primary key\" label=\"Primary key\" name=\"id\" sqlname=\"iRecipientId\" type=\"long\"/>\n  </element>\n</schema>\n```\n\nIn addition to the definition of the key and its index, a numeric field called \"id\" has been added to the extended schema in order to contain the auto-generated primary key.\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n>\n>A record with a primary key set to 0 is automatically inserted on creation of the table.
