We will send a delivery to several people to highlight the difference between people and recipients while detailing the calculation method for the following indicators:\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Clicks]** \n* **[!UICONTROL Distinct clicks for the population reached]** \n* **[!UICONTROL Distinct opens for the population reached]** \n* **[!UICONTROL Estimation of forwards]** \n* **[!UICONTROL Raw reactivity]**\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>These indicators are used in the **[!UICONTROL Tracking indicators]** report. For more on this, refer to [Tracking indicators](../../reporting/using/delivery-reports.md#tracking-indicators).\n\nThree links are added to a delivery. It is sent to 4 recipients:\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_indicators_example_1.png)\n\n* **[!UICONTROL John Davis]** : this recipient does not open the email (and therefore does not click any links).\n* **[!UICONTROL Marie Stuart]** : opens the email but does not click any links.\n* **[!UICONTROL Florian David]** : opens the email and clicks the links 9 times. He also forwards the email to someone who opens it and clicks twice.\n* **[!UICONTROL Henry Macdonald]** : this recipient has configured their internet browser to reject cookies. He opens the email and clicks the links 4 times.\n\nThe following tracking logs are returned:\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_indicators_example_2.png)\n\nTo get a clearer idea of how people and recipients are counted, we are going to analyze the logs of each profile.\n\n## Step 1: John {#step-1--john}\n\n**[!UICONTROL John Davis]** does not open the email (and therefore does not click any links).\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_indicators_example_8.png)\n\nSince John neither opened nor clicked in the email, he doesn't appear in the logs.\n\n**Intermediate calculation:**\n\n|   | Recipients who clicked  | People who clicked  | Recipients who opened  |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|  John  | -  | -  | -  |\n|  Intermediate total  | 0  | 0  | 0  |\n\n## Step 2: Marie {#step-2--marie}\n\n**[!UICONTROL Marie Stuart]** opens the email but does not click any links.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_indicators_example_7.png)\n\nMarie's open is displayed in the following log:\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_indicators_example_4bis.png)\n\nThe open is assigned to a recipient: Marie. Adobe Campaign therefore adds a new recipient to the count.\n\n**Intermediate calculation:**\n\n|   | Recipients who clicked  | People who clicked  | Recipients who opened  |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|  John  | -  | -  | -  |\n|  Marie  | -  | -  | +1  |\n|  Intermediate total  | 0  | 0  | 1  |\n\n## Step 3: Florian {#step-3--florian}\n\n**[!UICONTROL Florian David]** opens the email and clicks the links 9 times. He also forwards the email to someone who opens it and clicks twice.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_indicators_example_9.png)\n\nFlorian's actions (one open and 9 clicks) appear in the following logs:\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_indicators_example_3bis.png)\n\n**Recipients**: the open and the clicks are assigned to the same recipient (Florian). Since this recipient is different from the previous one (Marie), Adobe Campaign adds a new recipient to the count.\n\nPeople: Since this recipient's browser accepts cookies, we can see that the same identifier (UUID) is assigned to all click logs: **`fe37a503 [...]`**. Adobe Campaign correctly identifies these clicks as belonging to the same person. A new person is added to the count.\n\n**Intermediate calculation:**\n\n|   | Recipients who clicked  | People who clicked  | Recipients who opened  |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|  John  | -  | -  | -  |\n|  Marie  | -  | -  | +1  |\n|  Florian  | +1  | +1  | +1  |\n|  Intermediate total  | 1  | 1  | 2  |\n\nThe following logs coincide with the open and two clicks carried out by the person whom Florian forwarded the email to:\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_indicators_example_6bis.png)\n\n**Recipients**: its open and clicks are assigned to the recipient who forwarded the email (Florian). Since this recipient has already been counted, the recipient count remains the same. \n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_indicators_example_12.png)\n\n**People**: concerning clicks, we can see that the same identifier (UUID) is assigned to all logs: **`9ab648f9 [...]`**. This identifier hasn't been counted yet. A new person is therefore added to the count. \n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_indicators_example_13.png)\n\n**Intermediate calculation:**\n\n|   | Recipients who clicked  | People who clicked  | Recipients who opened  |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|  John  | -  | -  | -  |\n|  Marie  | -  | -  | +1  |\n|  Florian  | +1  | +1  | +1  |\n|  Unknown person  | -  | +1  | -  |\n|  Intermediate total  | 1  | 2  | 2  |\n\n## Step 4: Henry {#step-4--henry}\n\n**[!UICONTROL Henry Macdonald]** has configured his internet browser to reject cookies. He opens the email and clicks the links 4 times.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_indicators_example_10.png)\n\nThe open and 4 clicks carried out by Henry appear in the following logs:\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_indicators_example_5bis.png)\n\n**Recipients**: the open and clicks are assigned to the same recipient (Henry). Since this recipient hasn't been counted yet, Adobe Campaign adds a recipient to the count.\n\n**People**: Since Henry's browser does not accept cookies, a new identifier (UUID) is generated for each click. Each of the 4 clicks is interpreted as coming from a different person. Since these identifiers haven't been counted yet, they are added to the count.\n\n**Intermediate calculation:**\n\n|   | Recipients who clicked  | People who clicked  | Recipients who opened  |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|  John  | -  | -  | -  |\n|  Marie  | -  | -  | +1  |\n|  Florian  | +1  | +1  | +1  |\n|  Unknown person  | -  | +1  | -  |\n|  Henry  | +1  | +4  | +1  |\n|  Intermediate total  | 2  | 6  | 3  |\n\n## Summary {#summary}\n\nAt the delivery level, we have the following results:\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_indicators_example.png)\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Clicks]** (recipients who clicked): 2\n* **[!UICONTROL Distinct clicks for the population reached]** (people who clicked): 6\n* **[!UICONTROL Distinct opens for the population reached]** (recipients who opened): 3\n\nRaw reactivity and estimation of forwards are calculated as follows: \n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_indicators_example11.png)\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Estimation of forwards]** = **B - A** (thus 6 - 2 = 4)\n* **[!UICONTROL Raw reactivity]** = **A / C** (thus 2 / 3 = 66,67%)\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>In the following formulas:  \n>\n>* A represents the **[!UICONTROL Clicks]** indicator (recipients who clicked).\n>* B represents the **[!UICONTROL Distinct clicks for the population reached]** indicator (people who clicked).\n>* C represents the **[!UICONTROL Distinct opens for the population reached]** indicator (recipients who opened).\n","headers":[["title","Person, people and recipients"],["description","Person, people and recipients"],["feature","Reporting, Monitoring"]],"sections":[{"section":"Person/people and recipients","sectionId":"28ee8a20-8ee4-4cf7-9d76-26c74582c4b7","paragraphs":["This sample will help you understanding the difference between a person/a people and a recipient in Adobe Campaign.
