In this use case, the first two deliveries enable you to send different contents to population A and B. The third delivery is the fall-back delivery: it will be sent to the recipients who do not belong to A nor B. Its content will be calculated by a script and will be identical to either A or B, depending on which one scored the highest open rate. We need to configure a wait period for the third delivery, to find out the outcome of deliveries A and B. This is why the third delivery includes a **[!UICONTROL Wait]** activity.\n\n1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Split]** activity and link the transition destined for population A to one of the email deliveries already in the workflow.\n\n   ![](assets/use_case_abtesting_createdeliveries_001.png)\n\n1. Double-click the delivery to open it.\n1. Using the drop-down list, select the template for delivery A.\n\n   ![](assets/use_case_abtesting_createdeliveries_003.png)\n\n1.
