Follow the installation procedure for the Adobe Campaign server: **nlserver** package on Linux or **setup.exe** on Windows.\n\n   For more on this, refer to [Prerequisites of Campaign installation in Linux](../../installation/using/prerequisites-of-campaign-installation-in-linux.md) (Linux) and [Prerequisites of Campaign installation in Windows](../../installation/using/prerequisites-of-campaign-installation-in-windows.md) (Windows).\n\n1. Once the Adobe Campaign server is installed, start the application server (web) using the command **nlserver web -tomcat** (the Web module enables you to start Tomcat in standalone Web server mode listening on port 8080) and to make sure Tomcat starts correctly:\n\n   ```sql\n   12:08:18 >   Application server for Adobe Campaign Classic (7.X YY.R build XXX@SHA1) of DD/MM/YYYY\n   12:08:18 >   Starting Web server module (pid=28505, tid=-1225184768)...\n   12:08:18 >   Tomcat started\n   12:08:18 >   Server started\n   ```\n\n\n   >[!NOTE]\n   >\n   >The first time the Web module is executed it creates the **config-default.xml** and **serverConf.xml** files in the **conf** directory under the installation folder. All the parameters available in the **serverConf.xml** are listed in this [section](../../installation/using/the-server-configuration-file.md).\n\n   Press **Ctrl+C** to stop the server.\n\n   For more on this, refer to the following sections:\n\n    * For Linux: [First start-up of the server](../../installation/using/installing-packages-with-linux.md#first-start-up-of-the-server)\n    * For Windows: [First start-up of the server](../../installation/using/installing-the-server.md#first-start-up-of-the-server)\n\n1. Change the **internal** password using the command:\n\n   ```\n   nlserver config -internalpassword\n   ```\n\n   For more on this, refer to [this section](../../installation/using/configuring-campaign-server.md#internal-identifier).\n\n1. Create the **demo** instance with the DNS masks for tracking (in this case, **tracking.campaign.net**) and access to client consoles (in this case, **console.campaign.net**). There are two ways of doing this:\n\n    * Create the instance via the console: \n    \n      ![](assets/install_create_new_connexion.png)\n\n      For more on this, refer to [Creating an instance and logging on](../../installation/using/creating-an-instance-and-logging-on.md).\n\n      or\n    \n    * Create the instance using command lines:\n\n      ```    \n      nlserver config -addinstance:demo/tracking.campaign.net*,console.campaign.net*\n      ```    \n    \n      For more on this, refer to [Creating an instance](../../installation/using/command-lines.md#creating-an-instance).\n\n1. Edit the **config-demo.xml** file (created via the previous command and located next to the **config-default.xml** file), check that the **mta** (delivery), **wfserver** (workflow), **inMail** (rebound mails) and **stat** (statistics) processes are enabled, then configure the address of the **app** statistics server:\n\n   ```xml\n   <?xml version='1.0'?>\n   <serverconf>  \n     <shared>    \n       <!-- add lang=\"eng\" to dataStore to force English for the instance -->    \n       <dataStore hosts=\"tracking.campaign.net*,console.campaign.net*\">      \n         <mapping logical=\"*\" physical=\"default\"/>    \n       </dataStore>  </shared>  \n       <mta autoStart=\"true\" statServerAddress=\"app\">\n       <wfserver autoStart=\"true\"/>  \n       <inMail autoStart=\"true\"/>  \n       <sms autoStart=\"false\"/>  \n       <listProtect autoStart=\"false\"/>\n   </serverconf>\n   ```\n\n   For more on this, refer to [this section](../../installation/using/configuring-campaign-server.md#enabling-processes).\n\n1. Edit the **serverConf.xml** file and specify the delivery domain, then specify the IP (or host) addresses of the DNS servers used by the MTA module to answer MX type DNS queries.\n\n   ```xml\n   <dnsConfig localDomain=\"campaign.com\" nameServers=\"192.0.0.1, 192.0.0.2\"/>\n   ```\n\n   >[!NOTE]\n   >\n   >The **nameServers** parameters is only used in Windows.\n\n   For more on this, refer to [Campaign server configuration](../../installation/using/configuring-campaign-server.md).\n\n1. Copy the client console setup program **setup-client-7.XX**, **YYYY.exe** to the **/datakit/nl/eng/jsp** folder. [Learn more](../../installation/using/client-console-availability-for-windows.md).\n\n1. Start the Adobe Campaign server (**net start nlserver6** in Windows, **/etc/init.d/nlserver6 start** in Linux) and run the command **nlserver pdump** once more to check for presence of all enabled modules.\n\n   >[!NOTE]\n   >\n   >Starting 20.1, we recommend using the following command instead (for Linux): **systemctl start nlserver**\n\n\n   ```sql\n   12:09:54 >   Application server for Adobe Campaign Classic (7.X YY.R build XXX@SHA1) of DD/MM/YYYY\n   syslogd@default (7611) - 9.2 MB\n   stat@demo (5988) - 1.5 MB\n   inMail@demo (7830) - 11.9 MB\n   watchdog (27369) - 3.1 MB\n   mta@demo (7831) - 15.6 MB\n   wfserver@demo (7832) - 11.5 MB\n   web@default (28671) - 40.5 MB\n   ```\n\n   This command also lets you know the version and build number of the Adobe Campaign server installed on the computer.\n\n1. Test the **nlserver web** module using the URL: [https://console.campaign.net/nl/jsp/logon.jsp](https://tracking.campaign.net/r/test).\n\n   This URL enables you to access the download page for the client setup program. [Learn more](../../installation/using/client-console-availability-for-windows.md).\n\n   Enter the **internal** login and associated password when you reach the access control page.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_install_access_client.png)\n\n### Installing and configuring the application server 2 {#installing-and-configuring-the-application-server-2}\n\nApply the following steps:\n\n1. Install the Adobe Campaign server.\n1. Copy the files of the instance you created onto application server 1.\n\n   We keep the same instance name as the application server 1.\n\n1. Change the **internal** to the same as application server 1.\n1. Link the database to the instance:\n\n   ```\n   nlserver config -setdblogin:PostgreSQL:campaign:demo@dbsrv -instance:demo\n   ```\n\n1. Edit the **config-demo.xml** file (created via the previous command and located next to the **config-default.xml** file), check that the **mta** (delivery), **wfserver** (workflow), **inMail** (rebound mails) and **stat** (statistics) processes are enabled, then configure the address of the **app** statistics server:\n\n   ```xml\n   <?xml version='1.0'?>\n   <serverconf>  \n     <shared>    \n       <!-- add lang=\"eng\" to dataStore to force English for the instance -->    \n       <dataStore hosts=\"tracking.campaign.net*,console.campaign.net*\">      \n         <mapping logical=\"*\" physical=\"default\"/>    \n       </dataStore>  </shared>  \n       <mta autoStart=\"true\" statServerAddress=\"app\">\n       <wfserver autoStart=\"true\"/>  \n       <inMail autoStart=\"true\"/>  \n       <sms autoStart=\"false\"/>  \n       <listProtect autoStart=\"false\"/>\n   </serverconf>\n   ```\n\n   For more on this, refer to [this section](../../installation/using/configuring-campaign-server.md#enabling-processes).\n\n1. Edit the **serverConf.xml** file and populate the DNS configuration of the MTA module:\n\n   ```xml\n   <dnsConfig localDomain=\"campaign.com\" nameServers=\"192.0.0.1, 192.0.0.2\"/>\n   ```\n\n   >[!NOTE]\n   >\n   >The **nameServers** parameter is only used in Windows.\n\n   For more on this, refer to [Campaign server configuration](../../installation/using/configuring-campaign-server.md).\n\n1. Start the Adobe Campaign servers.\n\n   For more on this, refer to the following sections:\n\n    * For Linux: [First start-up of the server](../../installation/using/installing-packages-with-linux.md#first-start-up-of-the-server)\n    * For Windows: [First start-up of the server](../../installation/using/installing-the-server.md#first-start-up-of-the-server)\n\n### Installing and configuring the frontal servers {#installing-and-configuring-the-frontal-servers}\n\nInstallation and configuration procedures are identical on both computers.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n\n1. Install the Adobe Campaign server,\n1. Comply with the Web server integration procedure (IIS, Apache) described in the following sections:\n\n    * For Linux: [Integration into a Web server for Linux](../../installation/using/integration-into-a-web-server-for-linux.md),\n    * For Windows: [Integration into a Web server for Windows](../../installation/using/integration-into-a-web-server-for-windows.md).\n\n1. Copy the **config-demo.xml** and **serverConf.xml** files created during installation. In the **config-demo.xml** file, activate the **trackinglogd** process and deactivate the **mta**, **inmail**, **wfserver** and **stat** processes.\n1. Edit the **serverConf.xml** file and populate the redundant tracking servers in the parameters of the redirection:\n\n   ```xml\n   <spareServer enabledIf=\"$(hostname)!='front_srv1'\" id=\"1\" url=\"https://front_srv1:8080\"/>\n   <spareServer enabledIf=\"$(hostname)!='front_srv2'\" id=\"2\" url=\"https://front_srv2:8080\"/>\n   ```\n\n1. Start the website and test the redirection from the URL: [https://tracking.campaign.net/r/test](https://tracking.campaign.net/r/test)\n\n   The browser should display the following messages (depending on the URL redirected by the load balancer):\n\n   ```xml\n   <redir status=\"OK\" date=\"AAAA/MM/JJ HH:MM:SS\" build=\"XXXX\" host=\"tracking.campaign.net\" localHost=\"front_srv1\"/>\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```xml\n   <redir status=\"OK\" date=\"AAAA/MM/JJ HH:MM:SS\" build=\"XXXX\" host=\"tracking.campaign.net\" localHost=\"front_srv2\"/>\n   ```\n\n   For more on this, refer to the following sections:\n\n    * For Linux: [Launching the Web server and testing the configuration](../../installation/using/integration-into-a-web-server-for-linux.md#launching-the-web-server-and-testing-the-configuration),\n    * For Windows: [Launching the Web server and testing the configuration](../../installation/using/integration-into-a-web-server-for-windows.md#launching-the-web-server-and-testing-the-configuration).\n\n1.
