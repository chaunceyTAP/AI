Obtaining any necessary consent for that processing is the responsibility of the Data Controller. While Adobe Campaign may provide some features to help a customer manage consent related to the service, Adobe is not responsible for consent. Customers should work with their own legal departments to determine their own processes and practices for any necessary consent.\n\nThe features to help manage some aspects of consent have been core to Adobe Campaign since the beginning. Through the subscription management process, customers can track which recipients have opted-in to which type of subscriptions whether it be newsletters, daily or weekly promotions, or any other type of marketing program.\n\n![](assets/privacy-consent-management.png)\n\nFor more on Consent management, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../delivery/using/managing-subscriptions.md).\n\nIn addition to the Consent Management tools provided by Adobe Campaign, you have the possibility to track whether a consumer has opted-out for the sale of Personal Information. Refer to [this section](../../platform/using/privacy-requests.md#sale-of-personal-information-ccpa).\n\n### Data retention {#data-retention}\n\nRegarding retention, built-in log tables in Campaign have pre-set retention periods on them, generally limiting their data storage to six months or less.\n\nThe following are the default retention values for built-in tables.

For example, you might have different marketers covering different geos and each marketer can only access data from their geo.\n\nSimilarly, this functionality also allows you to configure different capabilities for each user, such as limiting who can send deliveries, or more relevant for Privacy management, who can modify or export data.\n\n![](assets/privacy-user-management.png)\n\nFor more on access management, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../platform/using/access-management.md).\n","headers":[["title","Privacy management"],["description","Learn more about Privacy management"],["feature","Privacy, Privacy Tools"],["topic-tags","starting-with-adobe-campaign"]],"sections":[{"section":"Privacy management","sectionId":"5f20edb6-d45f-41cf-a1cf-fa9cc773f939","paragraphs":["Adobe Campaign offers a set of tools to help you comply with Privacy regulations (including GDPR, CCPA, PDPA, LGPD).","Here are the five main capabilities offered by Adobe Campaign to ensure privacy regulations readiness:","Right to Access\nRight to Delete\nConsent management\nData retention\nRights management","For more on this, see Right to Access and Right to be Forgotten and Consent, Retention and Roles."]},{"section":"Regulations on privacy management","sectionId":"94b54ca1-b32f-416d-9527-7b6d061ef3e4","paragraphs":["Adobe Campaign's capabilities help you comply with the following regulations:","GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is the European Union's (EU) privacy law that harmonizes and modernizes data protection requirements for EU's countries.\nCCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) provides California residents new rights in regards to their personal information and imposes data protection responsibilities on certain entities whom conduct business in California.\nPDPA (Personal Data Protection Act) is the privacy law that harmonizes and modernizes data protection requirements for Thailand. \nLGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados) applies to all companies collecting or processing personal data in Brazil.\nCASL (Canadian Anti-Spam Law) covers all messages sent into or out of Canada but does not include messages routed through Canada,  \nVCDPA (Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act) and CPA (Colorado Privacy Act) apply to all companies that conduct business or target residents within those states.","All of these regulations apply to Adobe Campaign customers who hold data for Data Subjects residing in the respective regions or countries mentioned above.","NOTE","For more on personal data and on the different entities that manage data (Data Controller, Data Processor and Data Subject), see Personal data and Personas."]},{"section":"Right to Access and Right to be Forgotten","sectionId":"4dfbdd2d-af68-4bdc-88de-b79fad4f7aed","paragraphs":["In order to help you facilitate your Privacy readiness, Adobe Campaign allows you to handle Access and Delete requests.","The Right to Access is the right for the Data Subject to obtain from the Data Controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning them is being processed, where and for what purpose.
