They are deployed automatically in the **[!UICONTROL Live]** environment (i.e. made available) when the created/modified offer(s) they contain are approved. By default, the **[!UICONTROL Design]** environment contains a category to receive all offers. Sub-categories can be created to add hierarchy to the catalog offers.\n\nFor each category, you can define eligibility dates, i.e. a period beyond which the offers contained in the category may no longer be presented to their target. If you want the offers from a specific category to be selected as a priority by the offer engine, to better expose a product for example, you can increase their weights for a given period by adding a multiplying weight to the category.\n\nTo create an additional category, apply the following steps:\n\n1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Offer catalog]** folder.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_cat_create_001.png)\n\n1. Right click and select **[!UICONTROL Create a new \"Offer category\" folder]** from the drop-down list.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_cat_create_002.png)\n\n1. Re-name the category.
