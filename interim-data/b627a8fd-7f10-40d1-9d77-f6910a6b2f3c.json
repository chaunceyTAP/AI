These data filters can be used for each type of editor (or document) in the application.\n\nData filters are created in the same way as predefined filters, but there is an additional field to select the document type to which the filter will be applied.\n\nApply the following steps:\n\n1. Create a new filter via the **[!UICONTROL Administration > Configuration > Predefined filters]** node.\n1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Select link]** icon to select the concerned document:\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_user_filter_choose_schema.png)\n\n1.

Click **[!UICONTROL Edit link]** to view the fields of the selected document.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_user_filter_edit_schema.png)\n\n   You can then view the content of the selected document:\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_user_filter_view_schema.png)\n\n   You can access these fields to define filter conditions in the body of the filter editor. An application filter is defined in exactly the same way as an advanced filter. See [Create an advanced filter](../../platform/using/creating-filters.md#creating-an-advanced-filter).\n\n1. Create a new filter on subscriptions to display only subscriptions with an undefined email format:\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_user_filter_parameters.png)\n\n1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** to add a filter to the pre-defined filters for this type of list.\n1. You can now use this filter in the **[!UICONTROL Subscriptions]** tab of the recipient profile; you can access the \"Unknown email format\" filter by clicking the **[!UICONTROL Filters]** button.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_user_filter_on_events.png)\n\n   The name of the current filter is displayed above the list.
