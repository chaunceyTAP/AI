This behavior can impact the workflow performance. Use the **[!UICONTROL Fork]** activity if you need to run several activities independently. Optionally, you can join the outbound activities before the subsequent part of the workflow.\n\nTo configure a **[!UICONTROL Fork]** activity and its related activities, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the **[!UICONTROL Fork]** activity and define the name and the label of the outbound transitions.\n\n    ![](assets/s_user_segmentation_fork.png)\n\n1. Open each outbound transition and configure it.\n1. Optionally, to join outbound transitions, add an AND-join activity. [Learn more](and-join.md).\n\n   The subsequent part of the workflow runs only upon completion of the joined outbound transitions.\n\n## Example: segmentation\n\nIn this example, different emails are sent to different population groups. A **[!UICONTROL Fork]** activity is used after a query, to perform two actions in parallel:\n\n* Save the query result\n* Segment the result to send multiple deliveries\n\n    ![The fork activity follows the intersection of two queries and precedes a list update activity and a split activity.](assets/wkf_fork_example.png)\n\nThe workflow comprises these activities:\n\n1. **[!UICONTROL Query]** activity\n\n   Two population groups are selected: women and Parisians.\n\n1. **[!UICONTROL Intersection]** activity\n\n   The intersection of the query results, that is, Parisian women, is selected.\n\n1. **[!UICONTROL Fork]** activity\n\n   The calculated population is saved and, in parallel, segmented into two groups:\n\n   1. Parisian women who are aged between 18 and 40\n   1. Parisian women over 40\n\n1. **[!UICONTROL Delivery]** activity\n\n   A different email is sent to each population group.\n\n## Use case: send a birthday email\n\nA recurring email is sent to a list of recipients on their birthday. A **[!UICONTROL Fork]** activity is used to include recipients who were born on February 29 on a leap year. [Learn more](sending-a-birthday-email.md) about this use case.\n\n![The fork activity follows a test activity and precedes two query activities.](assets/birthday-workflow_usecase_1.png)\n\n## Use case: automate content with a workflow\n\nThe creation and the delivery of a content block is automated. A **[!UICONTROL Fork]** activity is used to calculate the target and, in parallel, to create the content. [Learn more](../../delivery/using/automating-via-workflows.md#creating-the-delivery-and-its-content) about this use case.\n\n![The fork activity follows a delivery activity and precedes a query activity and a content management activity, which are both joined through an AND-join activity.](../../delivery/using/assets/d_ncs_content_workflow10.png)\n\nYou can then configure each outbound transitions, then join them together using an [AND-join](and-join.md) activity, if needed.
