Whether you import data from a local file or from a SFTP, you can use workflows to standardize your data management procedures.\n\n### Use data from a list: Read list {#using-data-from-a-list--read-list}\n\nThe data sent in a workflow can come from lists whereby the data has been prepared and structured beforehand.\n\nThis list may have been directly created in Adobe Campaign or imported by the **[!UICONTROL Import a list]** option. For more on this option, refer to this [page](../../platform/using/about-generic-imports-exports.md).\n\nFor more on using the read list activity in a workflow, refer to [this page](../../workflow/using/read-list.md).\n\n### Load data from a file {#loading-data-from-a-file}\n\nThe data processed in a workflow can be extracted from a structured file so that it can be imported into Adobe Campaign.\n\nA description of the loading data activity can be found in the [Data loading (file)](../../workflow/using/data-loading-file.md) section.\n\nExample of structured file to import:\n\n```\nlastname;firstname;birthdate;email;crmID\nSmith;Hayden;23/05/1989;hayden.smith@example.com;124365\nMars;Daniel;17/11/1987;dannymars@example.com;123545\nSmith;Clara;08/02/1989;hayden.smith@example.com;124567\nDurance;Allison;15/12/1978;allison.durance@example.com;120987\n```\n\nOnce data has been collected you can use it in your workflows, for example to enrich a delivery or update the database. For more on this, refer to [this page](../../workflow/using/how-to-use-workflow-data.md).\n\n## Export data {#exporting-data-via-a-workflow}\n\nWorkflows can be a useful way to automate some of your export processes or to export precise sets of data after using some of the available data management activities available to transform your data.\n\nExport operations are performed using a **[!UICONTROL Data extraction (file) activity]**. For more on how to configure and use the activity, refer to [this page](../../workflow/using/extraction-file.md).\n","headers":[["title","Importing and exporting data using workflows"],["description","Learn how to import and export data using workflows in Campaign"],["feature","Data Management, Workflows"],["topic-tags","importing-and-exporting-data"]],"sections":[{"section":"Import and export data using workflows","sectionId":"66184b12-f150-4aa6-b639-c4d170201d83","paragraphs":[]},{"section":"Collecting data","sectionId":"bfaa3df3-5ca2-43e9-bd82-fefc369d5c1e","paragraphs":["Workflows can be a useful way to automate some of your import processes.
