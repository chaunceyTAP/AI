Go to the **[!UICONTROL Campaigns]** tab and click the **[!UICONTROL Offers]** link.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_create_001.png)\n\n1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Create]** button.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_create_005.png)\n\n1. Change the label and select the category the offer should belong to.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_create_002.png)\n\n1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** to create the offer.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_create_003.png)\n\n   The offer is available in the platform and its content can be configured.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_create_004.png)\n\n## Configuring offer eligibility {#configuring-offer-eligibility}\n\nIn the **[!UICONTROL Eligibility]** tab, define the period the offer will be valid for and can be presented, the filters to apply to the target and the offer weight.\n\n### Defining the eligibility period of an offer {#defining-the-eligibility-period-of-an-offer}\n\nTo define the eligibility period of the offer, use the drop-down lists and select a start and an end date in the calendar.\n\n![](assets/offer_eligibility_create_002.png)\n\nOutside of these dates, the offer won't be selected by the Interaction engine. If you have also configured eligibility dates for the offer category, the most restrictive period will apply.\n\n### Filters on the target {#filters-on-the-target}\n\nYou can apply filters to the offer target.\n\nTo do this, click the **[!UICONTROL Edit query]** link and select the filter you want to apply. (Refer to [this section](../../platform/using/steps-to-create-a-query.md#step-4---filter-data)). \n\n![](assets/offer_eligibility_create_003.png)\n\nIf predefined filters have been created already, you can select them from the list of user filters. For more on this, refer to [Creating predefined filters](../../interaction/using/creating-predefined-filters.md).\n\n![](assets/offer_eligibility_create_004.png)\n\n### Offer weight {#offer-weight}\n\nTo enable the engine to decide between several offers that the target is eligible for, you need to assign one or more weights to the offer. You can also apply filters to the target if necessary or restrict the offer space which the weight will apply to. An offer with a more significant weight will be preferred over an offer with less weight.\n\nYou can configure multiple weights for the same offer, for example to distinguish sup-periods, specific targets or even an offer space.\n\nFor example, an offer can have a weight of A for contacts aged 18 to 25 and a weight of B for contacts above that range. If an offer is eligible all summer, it can also have a weight of A in July and a weight of B in August.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>The assigned weight can be temporarily modified according to the parameters of the category the offer belongs to. For more on this, refer to [Creating offer categories](../../interaction/using/creating-offer-categories.md).\n\nTo create a weight in an offer, apply the following steps:\n\n1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add]**.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_weight_create_001.png)\n\n1. Change the label and assign a weight. By default, it is 1.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_weight_create_006.png)\n\n   >[!IMPORTANT]\n   >\n   >If no weight is entered (0), the target will not be considered eligible for the offer.\n\n1. If you want the weight to apply for a given period, define eligibility dates.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_weight_create_002.png)\n\n1. If necessary, restrict the weight to a specific offer space. \n\n   ![](assets/offer_weight_create_003.png)\n\n1. Apply a filter to a target.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_weight_create_004.png)\n\n1. Click **[!UICONTROL OK]** to save the weight.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_weight_create_005.png)\n\n   >[!NOTE]\n   >\n   >If a target is eligible for multiple weights for a selected offer, the engine keeps the best (highest) weight. When calling up the offer engine, an offer is selected a maximum of once per contact.\n\n### Summary of offer eligibility rules {#a-summary-of-offer-eligibility-rules}\n\nOnce configuration is complete, a summary of the eligibility rules will be available on the offer dashboard.\n\nTo view it, click the **[!UICONTROL Schedule and eligibility rules]** link.\n\n![](assets/offer_eligibility_create_005.png)\n\n## Creating the offer content {#creating-the-offer-content}\n\n1.
