For more on this, refer to [this section](#approving-processes).\n\nThese settings can be overridden for each campaign created using this template, and individually for each campaign delivery: click the **[!UICONTROL Properties]** button, then the **[!UICONTROL Approvals]** tab.\n\nIn the following example, the delivery content will not require approvals:\n\n![](assets/s_user_validation_select_process_from_del.png)\n\n## Select reviewers {#selecting-reviewers}\n\nFor each type of approval, the operators or operator groups in charge of approval are selected from the drop-down list in the delivery. More operators can be added using the **[!UICONTROL Edit...]** link. This window also lets you edit the approval deadline. \n\n![](assets/s_user_validation_add_operator.png)\n\nIf no reviewer is specified, the campaign manager will be responsible for approval and will receive the notifications.

The campaign dashboard then offers a **[!UICONTROL Submit targeting for approval]** link to launch the approval process manually.\n\nA confirmation message lets you authorize approvals on the jobs selected for this delivery.\n\nThe approval buttons are then displayed on the campaign dashboard (for this delivery), on the delivery dashboard and in delivery tracking. If notifications are enabled, they will be sent in parallel.\n\nThis method of enabling approvals lets you work on targeting without sending spurious notifications to reviewers.\n\n## Notifications {#notifications}\n\nNotifications are specific email messages sent to reviewers to inform them that a process is pending approval. When the operator clicks the link in the message, an authentication page appears and, after logging in, the operator can view the information and approve or reject the job. A comment can also be entered in the approval window.\n\nThe content of notification emails can be personalized. See [Notification content](#notification-content).\n\n### Enable/Disable Notification {#enabling-disabling-notification}\n\nBy default, notification messages are sent if the approval of the related job is enabled in the campaign template, the campaign, or the delivery. Notifications can, however, be disabled in order to authorize approvals from the console only.\n\nTo do this, edit the approval window of the campaign or campaign template ( **[!UICONTROL Edit > Properties]** > **[!UICONTROL Advanced campaign settings...]** > **[!UICONTROL Approvals]** tab) and select **[!UICONTROL Do not enable notification sending]**.\n\n![](assets/s_user_validation_notif_desactivate.png)\n\n### Notification content {#notification-content}\n\nNotification content is defined in a specific template: **[!UICONTROL Notification of validations for the marketing campaign]**. This template is saved in the **[!UICONTROL Administration > Campaign management > Technical delivery templates]** folder of the Adobe Campaign tree.\n\n## Review and approve deliveries {#checking-and-approving-deliveries}\n\nAdobe Campaign lets you set up approval processes for the main stages of the marketing campaign in collaborative mode.\n\nFor direct mail deliveries, Adobe Campaign operators can view the extraction file before it is sent to the router, and if necessary they can change the format and re-launch extraction. See [Approve an extraction file](#approving-an-extraction-file).\n\nFor each campaign you can approve the delivery target, content (see [Approve content](#approving-content)) and costs. Adobe Campaign operators in charge of approval can be notified by email and can accept or reject approval from the console or via a web connection. See [Steps to approve a delivery](#approving-processes).\n\nWhen these validation phases are complete, the delivery can be launched. [Learn more](../../campaign/using/marketing-campaign-deliveries.md#starting-a-delivery).\n\n### Steps to approve a delivery {#approving-processes}\n\nThe stages requiring approval appear on the campaign dashboard (via the console of the web interface). They also appear in the delivery tracking table and on the delivery dashboard.\n\nAt this point, the status of the campaign is **[!UICONTROL To validate]**.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>To select the processes which require an approval, modify the campaign template. For more on this, refer to [Campaign templates](../../campaign/using/marketing-campaign-templates.md#campaign-templates).\n>\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_edit_del_to_validate.png)\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>In a targeting workflow, if an error linked to a configuration issue occurs during message preparation, the **[!UICONTROL Restart message preparation]** link is shown on the dashboard. Correct the error and click this link to restart message preparation while bypassing the targeting stage.\n\n![](assets/s_user_validation_relaunch_message_preparation.png)\n\nFor each delivery in the campaign, you can approve the following processes:\n\n* **Targeting, content and budget**\n\n  When the **[!UICONTROL Enable target approval]**, **[!UICONTROL Enable content approval]** or **[!UICONTROL Enable budget approval]** options are selected in the job approval settings window, the relevant links are shown in the campaign dashboard for the concerned deliveries.\n\n  >[!NOTE]\n  >\n  >Budget approval is only available if targeting approval is enabled in the approval settings window. The link for budget approval is only displayed once the target has been analyzed. Also, this link is displayed along with the link for target approval.\n\n  If the **[!UICONTROL Assign content editing]** or **[!UICONTROL External content approval]** options are selected in the approval settings window, the dashboard will show the **[!UICONTROL Available content]** and **[!UICONTROL External content approval]** links.\n\n  Content approval lets you access the proofs sent.\n\n* **Extraction approval (direct mail delivery)**\n\n  When **[!UICONTROL Enable extraction approval]** is selected in the approval settings window, the extracted file must be approved before the router can be notified.\n\n  An **[!UICONTROL Approve content]** link is available on the campaign dashboard as shown below:\n\n  ![](assets/s_ncs_user_edit_file_valid.png)\n\n  Extraction files can be previewed via the approval box, and then accepted or rejected.\n\n  ![](assets/s_ncs_user_edit_file_valid_preview_file.png)\n\n  >[!NOTE]\n  >\n  >The extraction file preview concerns a data sample only. The entire output file is not loaded.\n\n* **Approving associated deliveries**\n\n  The **[!UICONTROL Enable individual approval of each associated delivery]** option is used for one main delivery associated with secondary deliveries. By default, this option is not selected so that an overall approval of the main delivery can be performed. If this option is selected, each delivery must be approved individually.\n\n  ![](assets/s_ncs_user_task_valid_associate.png)\n\n### Select processes approve {#choosing-the-processes-to-be-approved}\n\nThe approval phases are defined with the template associated with the campaign. You must select the elements to be approved from the template and specify the Adobe Campaign operators responsible for these approvals. For more on campaign templates, refer to [this section](../../campaign/using/marketing-campaign-templates.md#campaign-templates).\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>The approval configuration for the campaign (or campaign template) applies to all future deliveries linked to this campaign. Any configuration changes will not be applied to previous deliveries.\n\nThis information can be overridden for each campaign and each delivery.\n\nFor a campaign, click the **[!UICONTROL Edit > Properties]** tab, then the **[!UICONTROL Advanced campaign settings...]** link, and finally the **[!UICONTROL Approvals]** sub-tab to access the approvals configuration page.\n\nYou can select and deselect the processes to approve and appoint Adobe Campaign operators in charge of approval. These can be individual operators, a group of operators, or a list of operators.\n\nTo select a list of operators, click the **[!UICONTROL Edit...]** link to the right of the field designating the first reviewer and add as many operators as necessary, as shown below:\n\n![](assets/s_user_validation_add_operator.png)\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>* If a list of reviewers is defined, a job is approved when one reviewer has accepted it. The relevant approval link is then no longer offered in the dashboard. When the sending of notifications is enabled, if another reviewer clicks the approval link in the notification message, they are notified that another operator has already approved the job.\n>* You can define an approval schedule for the campaign in the lower section of the reviewer editing window. By default, reviewers have three days starting from the submission date to approve a process. It's possible to configure a reminder which is automatically sent to the operators concerned before the approval deadline.\n>* You can add reminders from this section.\n>\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_edit_op_valid_calendar.png)\n\nFor each delivery, click the **[!UICONTROL Audit]** button and the **[!UICONTROL Approvals]** tab to view and edit approval dates and automatic reminders.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_edit_del_valid.png)\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>This tab is available once the content approval process has been started.\n\n### Approve a content {#approving-content}\n\n>[!CAUTION]\n>\n>To approve a content, a proof cycle is mandatory. Proofs let you approve the display of information, personalization data and check that links are working. Learn how to create a proof in [this section](../../delivery/using/steps-validating-the-delivery.md#sending-a-proof).\n>\n>The content approval functionalities detailed below relate to the proof delivery.\n\nIt is possible to configure a content approval cycle. To do this, select the **[!UICONTROL Enable content approval]** option in the approval settings window. The main steps of the content approval cycle are:\n\n1. After creating a new delivery, the campaign manager clicks the **[!UICONTROL Submit content]** link on the campaign dashboard to start the content approval cycle. \n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_user_validation_submit_content_validation.png)\n\n   >[!NOTE]\n   >\n   >If the **[!UICONTROL Enable the sending of proofs]** option (for email deliveries) or **[!UICONTROL Enable the sending and approval of proofs]** (for direct mail deliveries) options were selected in the approval settings window, proofs will be sent automatically.\n\n1. A notification email is sent to the person responsible for content, who can choose whether to approve it or not:\n\n    * via the notification email:\n    \n      ![](assets/s_ncs_user_del_content_valid_bat_notif.png)\n\n      >[!NOTE]\n      >\n      >The notification email contains a link to the proofs already sent, and possibly to a rendering of the message for the various webmails if the **Deliverability** option is enabled for this instance.\n\n    * via the console or web interface, delivery tracking, the delivery dashboard or the campaign dashboard:\n    \n      ![](assets/s_ncs_user_validation_content_bat_op.png)\n\n      >[!NOTE]\n      >\n      >This campaign dashboard lets you view the list of proofs that have been sent, by clicking the **[!UICONTROL Inbox rendering...]** link. To view their content, click the **[!UICONTROL Detail]** icon to the right of the list.\n      \n      ![](assets/s_ncs_user_validation_content_BAT_details.png)\n\n1. A notification email is sent to the person responsible for the campaign informing them of whether the content has been approved or not.\n\n   >[!NOTE]\n   >\n   >The person responsible for the campaign can re-start the content approval cycle at any time. To do this, click the link on the **[!UICONTROL Content status]** line of the campaign dashboard (at delivery level), then click **[!UICONTROL Reset content approval to submit it again]**.\n\n   ![](assets/s_user_validation_relaunch_content_validation.png)\n\n#### Assign content editing {#assign-content-editing}\n\nThis option lets you define someone in charge of content editing, such as a webmaster. If the **[!UICONTROL Assign content editing]** option is selected in the approval settings window, several approval steps are added between delivery creation and delivery of the notification email to the person in charge of content:\n\n1. After creating a new delivery, the person responsible for the campaign clicks the **[!UICONTROL Submit content editing]** link in the campaign dashboard to start the content editing cycle. \n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_user_validation_submit_content_edition.png)\n\n1. The person responsible for content editing will receive an email telling them that the content is available. \n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_user_validation_submit_content_notif.png)\n\n1. They can then log on to the console, open the delivery and edit it using a simplified wizard to change the subject, HTML and text content, and send proofs.\n\n   ![](assets/s_user_validation_content_edition.png)\n\n   >[!NOTE]\n   >\n   >If the **[!UICONTROL Enable the sending of proofs]** option (for email deliveries) or **[!UICONTROL Enable the sending and approval of proofs]** (for direct mail deliveries) options were selected in the approval settings window, proofs will be sent automatically.\n\n1. Once the person in charge of content editing has finished making any changes to the delivery content, they can make the content available.\n\n   To do this, they can:\n\n    * click the **[!UICONTROL Available content]** link via the Adobe Campaign console.\n    \n      ![](assets/s_ncs_user_validation_submit_content_available.png)\n\n    * click the link in the notification message, then approve content availability.\n    \n      ![](assets/s_ncs_user_validation_submit_content_available2.png)\n\n      The operator can add a comment before submitting the content to the person in charge of the campaign.\n    \n      ![](assets/s_ncs_user_validation_submit_content_available3.png)\n\n      The notification message lets the reviewer approve or reject the content.\n    \n      ![](assets/s_ncs_user_validation_submit_content_available4.png)\n\n#### External content approval {#external-content-approval}\n\nThis option lets you define an external operator in charge of approving delivery rendering, such as brand communication consistency, rates, etc. When the **[!UICONTROL External content approval]** option is selected in the approval settings window, several approval steps are added between content approval and the delivery of the notification to the person in charge of the campaign:\n\n1. The external content manager receives a notification email telling them that the content has been approved and requesting external approval.\n1. The notification email contains links to the proofs sent, which lets you view delivery rendering, and a button for approving or rejecting the delivery content.\n\n   >[!NOTE]\n   >\n   >These links are only available if one or more proofs have been sent. Otherwise, delivery rendering is only available via the console or the web interface.\n\n   ![](assets/s_user_validation_external_content.png)\n\n### Approve an extraction file {#approving-an-extraction-file}\n\nFor offline deliveries, Adobe Campaign generates an extraction file which, depending on how it is set up, is sent to the router. Its content depends on the export template used.\n\nWhen the content, targeting and budget have been approved, the delivery changes to **[!UICONTROL Extraction pending]** until the extraction workflow for the campaigns is launched. \n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_waiting_file_extraction.png)\n\nOn the extraction request date, the extraction file is created and the delivery status changes to **[!UICONTROL File to approve]**. \n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_file_extract_to_valid.png)\n\nYou can view the content of the extracted file (by clicking its name), approve it or, if necessary, change the format and re-launch the extraction using the links on the dashboard.\n\nOnce the file has been approved, you can send the notification email to the router. For more on this, refer to [Start an offline delivery](../../campaign/using/marketing-campaign-deliveries.md#starting-an-offline-delivery).\n","headers":[["title","Set up and manage the approval process"],["description","Learn how to manage approvals of marketing campaigns"],["feature","Approvals, Campaigns"]],"sections":[{"section":"Set up and manage the approval process","sectionId":"cbca409d-54a1-45db-a187-e48b1871ae86","paragraphs":["Each step of a delivery can be subject to approval in order to ensure full monitoring and control of the various processes of the campaign: targeting, content, budget, extraction, and sending a proof.","Notification messages are sent to the Adobe Campaign operators who are designated reviewers to inform them of an approval request.
