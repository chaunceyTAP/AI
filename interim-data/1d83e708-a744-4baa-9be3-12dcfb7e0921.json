Operators can enrich the data model that is provided by extending the resources to add custom fields or custom tables, such as transaction or product tables.\n\nLearn more about [Custom resources](../../configuration/using/about-schema-edition.md).\n+++\n\n+++**Data model**\n\nCampaign data model is a set of schemas that define the data types and their relationships (links). The data model is an abstract definition that is physically implemented with a database that contains the actual data.\n\nLearn more about [Data model](../../configuration/using/about-data-model.md).\n+++\n\n+++**Database cleanup workflow**\n\nThe Database cleanup workflow deletes obsolete data to avoid exponential growth of the database. The workflow is triggered automatically without user intervention.\n\nLearn more about [Database cleanup workflow](../../production/using/database-cleanup-workflow.md).\n+++\n\n<!--\n----UNCLEAR----\n+++**Dedicated server**\n\n*Context: Transactional Messaging*\n\nDedicated execution server(s) to leverage Transactional Messaging. A server can typically process up to 50,000 Engine Calls per hour. The “Per-Dedicated Server” designation does not necessarily have a 1:1 correlation with a physical server as Adobe may utilize virtualization technologies to achieve the equivalent effect.\n\nLearn more about [Transactional Messaging](../../message-center/using/about-transactional-messaging.md).\n+++\n-->\n\n+++**Deliverability**\n\n*Context: Email Deliverability*\n\nDeliverability allows you to measure the success of your campaigns reaching your recipients’ inbox without bouncing, or being marked as spam. More precisely, email deliverability refers to the set of characteristics that determine a message’s ability to reach its destination, via a personal email address, within a short time, and with the expected quality in terms of content and format.\n\nLearn more about [Deliverability](../../delivery/using/about-deliverability.md).\n+++\n\n+++**Delivery**\n\nA delivery is a specific marketing communication item which is sent to an audience on a specific channel (email, SMS, Push notification, etc.). Also known as a \"touch\" in marketing terminology. \n\nLearn more about [Deliveries](../../delivery/using/communication-channels.md).\n+++\n\n+++**Delivery analysis**\n\nDelivery analysis is the preparation of the delivery. This process combines the content with the recipient profile data to produce the personalized email that the recipient receives. The delivery analysis logic can exclude recipients from the target or stop the delivery altogether, based on the defined logic. This process also includes the evaluation of dynamic content logic and the insertion of offers specific to the individual recipient profile. \n\nLearn more about [Delivery analysis](../../delivery/using/steps-validating-the-delivery.md#analyzing-the-delivery).\n+++\n\n+++**Delivery logs**\n\nDelivery logs contain information generated when sending of a message. These logs show the detail of the sending, which message has been prepared, ignored, sent or failed. They can be accessed directly from the delivery dashboard.\n\nLearn more about [Delivery logs](../../delivery/using/delivery-dashboard.md#delivery-logs-and-history).\n+++\n\n<!--\n----STRANGE IN DOCS?----\n+++**Delivery fundamentals**\n\n*Context: Email Deliverability*\n\nAdobe Campaign Deliverability Fundamentals Consulting Service provides email deliverability consultation and reputation management to support customers using Adobe Campaign deliveries.\n\nLearn more about [Deliverability](../../delivery/using/about-deliverability.md).\n+++\n-->\n\n+++**Delivery outline**\n\n*Context: Direct Mail*\n\nA delivery outline is a structured set of elements (documents, stores, promotional coupons, etc.) created by the company and for a particular campaign.

This cooperation is based on a shared workspace known as the **list of Campaign packages**, where centrally created campaign templates and instances are offered to local entities.\n\nLearn more about [Distributed Marketing](../../distributed/using/about-distributed-marketing.md)\n+++\n\n+++**Distribution of values**\n\nThe Distribution of values is a tool which shows the distribution of the values for a schema attribute that currently exist in the database. This helps you determine what values are available, their counts and percentages, and to avoid issues with capitalization and spelling of values when creating a query or expression.\n\nLearn more about [Distribution of values](../../platform/using/defining-filter-conditions.md#selecting-data-to-extract)\n+++\n\n+++**Domain delegation**\n\nSubdomain configuration allows you to configure a sub-section of your domain (technically a “DNS zone”) for use with Adobe Campaign.\nDomain delegation lets Adobe control and maintain all aspects of DNS that are required for delivering, rendering and tracking of email campaigns.\n\nLearn more about [Domain delegation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/control-panel/using/subdomains-and-certificates/setting-up-new-subdomain.html)\n+++\n\n## E - H {#sec-2}\n\n<!--\n----DEPRECATED------>\n+++**E4X**\n\nE4X is the version of Javascript that is used in Adobe Campaign Classic. Sometimes called ECMAScript, it is an extension of Javascript that allows the mixing of Javascript and XML primitives in the same code. Note that E4X is classified as a deprecated language. \n+++\n\n\n+++**Eligibility rules**\n\n*Context: Campaign Interaction*\n\nEligibility rules are constraints applied to an environment, category or offer concerning the validity period, target and weight. They let Operators ensure that an offer is in line with the targeted contact. In the offer environment, eligibility rules include presentation rules applied to the offers and the recipients to target. In the category, eligibility rules let Operators limit the validity of the category in time, define application themes and determine the recipients to target. They can also define a multiplier weight for a given period of time. This lets Operators share the rules for offers in other categories and so simplifies their management. In an offer, eligibility rules let Operators limit the validity of offers in time and determine the recipients to target. \n\nLearn more about [Eligibility rules](../../interaction/using/interaction-and-offer-management.md).\n+++\n\n+++**Eligible offer**\n\n*Context: Campaign Interaction*\n\nAn eligible offer is an offer meeting the constraints defined upstream that can be consistently offered to a target.\n\nLearn more about [Interaction](../../interaction/using/interaction-and-offer-management.md).\n+++\n\n+++**Email BCC**\n\nEmail BCC capability sends an exact copy in EML format of a corresponding delivered email, which is saved to a dedicated BCC email address where the emails can be processed and archived by the sender in an external system.\n\nLearn more about [Email BCC](../../delivery/using/email-parameters.md#email-bcc).\n+++\n\n<!--\n-----STRANGE FOR DOCS?----\n+++**Email volume commitment**\n\nThe anticipated emails sent per year as set forth in the Sales Order.

This activity is generally used following targeting activities or after importing a file and before activities that use of targeted data. Enrichments can transform the inbound transition data and configure the activity to complete the output transition with enhanced data. It allows the Operator to combine data from multiple data sets, or to create links to a temporary resource.\n\nLearn more about [Enrichment activity](../../workflow/using/enrichment.md).\n+++\n\n+++**Enumerations**\n\nAn enumeration is a data type defined in schemas or at the Platform level that defines the valid input values for a field. Enumerations appear in the user interface and in query builders as a picklist.\n\nLearn more about [Enumerations](../../platform/using/managing-enumerations.md).\n+++\n\n+++**Explorer view**\n\nThe Explorer view is a hierarchical display of the folders that hold Adobe Campaign artifacts and data. Note that the folder system in Adobe Campaign does not function like a typical treeview, in that each folder holds data of a specific type, such as Deliveries, Workflows or Offers.\n\nLearn more about [Explorer view](../../platform/using/adobe-campaign-explorer.md).\n+++\n\n+++**External accounts**\n\nExternal accounts are entry and exit points for the product to connect to other environments and technologies. External accounts define the connection parameters the product uses to send data to or receive data from other sources. Typical external account types are connections for SFTP sites, telecoms to support the sending of SMS, mailboxes for the processing bounces, or connections to external databases. \n\nLearn more about [External accounts](../../installation/using/external-accounts.md).\n+++\n\n+++**Fatigue management**\n\n*Context: Campaign Optimization*\n\nFatigue management helps you control the frequency and quantity of messages to avoid over-solicitation of recipients and is often applied using a typology rule.\n\nLearn more about [Fatigue management](../../campaign-opt/using/pressure-rules.md).\n+++\n\n+++**Federated Data Access (FDA)**\n\nFederated Data Access supports the extension of the client data model to include a third-party database. It will automatically detect the structure of the targeted tables and use data from the SQL sources. You can access external data without changing the structure of Adobe Campaign data.\n\nLearn more about [Federated Data Access](../../installation/using/about-fda.md).\n+++\n\n+++**File extraction approval**\n\n*Context: Direct Mail*\n\nThe File extraction approval is the process of having a separate Operator or group of Operators approve the content and configuration of an extracted file before it is sent to an outside vendor, such as for a direct mail delivery.\n\nLearn more about [File extraction approval](../../delivery/using/validating.md).\n+++\n\n+++**Filtering dimension**\n\nThe filtering dimension is the schema that contains the data or attributes used by a query to filter the desired rows. The Filtering dimension schema must be directly linked to the defined Targeting dimension to allow Adobe Campaign to cross the database join and return the respondent rows.\n\nLearn more about [Filtering dimension](../../workflow/using/building-a-workflow.md#targeting-and-filtering-dimensions).\n+++\n\n+++**Folder**\n\nA folder is an Explorer view item that holds database records of a specific data type. The exception is the Generic folder type that is used as an organizing element and does not contain any data itself, only other folders. \n\nLearn more about [Folders](../../platform/using/adobe-campaign-explorer.md).\n+++\n\n+++**Folder view**\n\nThe Folder view is a special Explorer folder type that is used to display all records of a selected data type, no matter what folder it belongs to. Folder views are used as an administrative tool to manage partitioned data or data that is distributed among many folders.\n\nLearn more about [Folder View](../../platform/using/adobe-campaign-explorer.md).\n+++\n\n+++**Forms**\n\nForms define the interface representation for a specific schema type. Forms are the means used to easily create and edit data elements in the product, such as Recipients, Deliveries and Campaigns. All interface elements in Adobe Campaign are created in the product itself using Forms. Note that forms are optional and not all schemas have forms. \n\nLearn more about [Forms](../../configuration/using/identifying-a-form.md).\n+++\n\n<!--\n-----USEFUL HERE?-----\n+++**Generated SQL query**\n\nThe SQL code generated for the underlying database when an operator manipulates a schema. Schemas define the data types that are then implemented using database tables and columns. The SQL generated for schema manipulation (such as in a query) is based on the installed database type. Thus, the database can be swapped to a different type and the queries in Campaign remain unchanged. Adobe refers to this functionality as being database-agnostic.\n\nLearn more about [Generated SQL queries](../../platform/using/steps-to-create-a-query.md#step-6---preview-data).\n+++\n-->\n\n+++**Heatmap**\n\nCampaign Heatmap is a table showing workflow execution information for a 24-hour period.

The navigation tree works like a file browser (e.g. Windows Explorer). Folders may contain sub-folders. Selecting a node displays the view corresponding to the node. The view displayed is a list associated with a schema and an input form to edit the selected line. You can customize the navigation tree and set permissions on folders.\n\nLearn more about [Navigation Tree](../../platform/using/adobe-campaign-explorer.md#about-navigation-hierarch).\n+++\n\n+++**Objectives**\n\n*Context: Marketing Resource Management (MRM)*\n\nWithin the campaign, program or plan, Operators can state a list of objectives. These are quantified values to be reached. At the end of the campaign, program or plan, the MRM module lets Operators compare the objectives and results in dedicated reports. \n\nLearn more about [Objectives](../../mrm/using/creating-and-managing-tasks.md#expenses-and-revenues).\n+++\n\n+++**Offer catalog**\n\n*Context: Campaign Interaction*\n\nAn offer catalog is a set of offers defined in Adobe Campaign that can be selected during an interaction. The catalog is organized hierarchically with each node corresponding to a category. \n\nLearn more about [Offer catalog](../../interaction/using/offer-catalog-overview.md).\n+++\n\n+++**Offer contact**\n\n*Context: Campaign Interaction*\n\nAn offer contact is a contact from an inbound interaction. During engine call processing, the contact is associated with a targeting dimension. Non-identified, anonymous contacts are attributed to the visitor targeting dimension. There are two types of contacts, identified and anonymous:\n\n* **Identified contact**: a contact that has voluntarily been identified on the channel. In outbound interactions, the contact is automatically identified.\n* **Anonymous contact**: a contact that has not voluntarily subscribed through the channel but can be implicitly identified through a cookie. This terminology is only used for incoming interactions.\n\nLearn more about [Interaction](../../interaction/using/interaction-and-offer-management.md).\n+++\n\n+++**Offer Design environment**\n\n*Context: Campaign Interaction*\n\nThe Offer **Design Environment** is the environment in which operators create offers, define typology rules, and select the schema that will be targeted by the offers. The table for storing generated offer propositions are also defined by the environment. By default, the Interaction add-on comes with a **Design** environment and a **Live** environment linked to it. Both environments are pre-configured to target the built-in recipient table.\n\nLearn more about [Offer Design environments](../../interaction/using/fundamental-principles.md).\n+++\n\n+++**Offer engine arbitrage**\n\n*Context: Campaign Interaction*\n\nThe offer engine selects the offers that will be shown on an environment (eligible offers).
