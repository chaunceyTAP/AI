Libpq allows client programs to send queries to the PostgreSQL backend server and to receive these queries' results.\n\nFollow the steps below to configure access to [!DNL PostgreSQL]:\n\n* For CentOS, execute the following command `sudo apt-get -y install libpq-dev`.\n\n* For Linux, execute the following command `yum install postgresql-devel`.\n\n* For Windows, Libpq is implemented through `libpq.dll` which is included in Adobe Campaign installation.\n\nIn Adobe Campaign, you can then configure your [!DNL PostgreSQL] external account. For more on how to configure your external account, refer to [this section](#postgresql-external).\n\n## PostgreSQL external account {#postgresql-external}\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n> PostgreSQL is available on CentOS 7 and 6.\n\nYou need to create a [!DNL PostgreSQL] external account to connect your Campaign instance to your [!DNL PostgreSQL] external database.\n\n1.
