From the delivery wizard, you can import an HTML page containing images or insert images directly using the HTML editor via the **[!UICONTROL Image]** icon.\n\n\n### Guardrails {#img-guardrails}\n\nTo avoid performance issues, images included in emails cannot exceed 100 KB. This limit, set by default, can be changed from the `NmsDelivery_MaxDownloadedImageSize` option. However, Adobe strongly recommends to avoid large images in your email deliveries.\n\nLearn more in [the list of Campaign Classic options](../../installation/using/configuring-campaign-options.md#delivery).  \n\n### Types of images {#img-types}\n\nImages can be:\n\n* A local image, or an image called from a server\n* An image stored in the Adobe Campaign public resources library\n\n  Public resources are accessible via the **[!UICONTROL Resources > Online]** node of the Adobe Campaign hierarchy.

To do this, enter it in the **[!UICONTROL Images URL]** field. This value overrides the value defined in the parameters of the installation wizard.\n\nWhen you open HTML content with included images in the delivery wizard, a message gives you the option of uploading the images immediately, according to the delivery parameters.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_email_del_img_local.png)\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n>\n> The image URLs are modified during manual uploading or when sending messages.\n> \n\n### Use case: send a message with images {#uc-images}\n\nBelow is a sample of a delivery with four images:\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_images_in_delivery_wiz_1.png)\n\nThese images come from a local directory or Web site as you can verify from the **[!UICONTROL Source]** tab.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_images_in_delivery_wiz_2.png)\n\nClick the **[!UICONTROL Tracking & Images]** icon and then the **[!UICONTROL Images]** tab to start detecting images in the message.\n\nFor each image detected, you can view its status:\n\n* If an image is stored locally or located on another server, even if this server is visible from the outside (on an internet site, for example), it will be detected as **[!UICONTROL Not yet online]**.\n* The images are detected as **[!UICONTROL Already online]** if they were uploaded earlier while creating another delivery.\n* In the deployment wizard, you can define URLs for which image detection is not enabled: uploading these images will be **[!UICONTROL Skipped]**.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>Images are identified by their content and not by their access paths. This means that an image uploaded previously under a different name or in a different directory will be detected as **[!UICONTROL Already online]**.\n\nDuring the analysis phase, the images are automatically uploaded to the server so that they are accessible from the exterior, except for the local images which must be uploaded beforehand.\n\nYou can work ahead and upload images so that they can be viewed by other Adobe Campaign operators. You may find this useful if working collaboratively. To do this, click **[!UICONTROL Upload the images straightaway...]** to upload the images onto the server.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_images_in_delivery_wiz_3.png)\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>The URLs of the images in the email, and their names in particular, are then modified.\n\nOnce the images are online, you can view changes to their names and paths from the **[!UICONTROL Source]** tab of the message.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_images_in_delivery_wiz_4.png)\n\nIf you select **[!UICONTROL Include the images in the email]**, you can choose which images to include in the corresponding column.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_images_in_delivery_wiz_5.png)\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>If local images are included in the message, you must confirm changes to the message source code.\n\n## Insert a personalized barcode{#insert-a-barcode}\n\nThe barcode generation module lets you create several types of barcodes that comply with many common standards, including 2D barcodes.\n\nIt is possible to dynamically generate a barcode as a bitmap using a value defined using customer criteria. Personalized barcodes can be included in email campaigns. The recipient can print the message and show it to the issuing company for scanning (when checking out for example).\n\nTo insert a barcode into an email, place the cursor in the content where you want to display it, then click the personalization button. Select **[!UICONTROL Include > Barcode...]**.\n\n![](assets/barcode_insert_14.png)\n\nThen configure the following elements to suit your needs:\n\n1. Select the type of barcode.\n\n    * For 1D format, the following types are available in Adobe Campaign: Codabar, Code 128, GS1-128 (formerly EAN-128), UPC-A, UPC-E, ISBN, EAN-8, Code39, Interleaved 2 of 5, POSTNET and Royal Mail (RM4SCC).\n\n      Example of a 1D barcode:\n\n      ![](assets/barcode_insert_08.png)\n\n    * The DataMatrix and PDF417 types concern the 2D format.\n\n      Example of a 2D barcode:\n\n      ![](assets/barcode_insert_09.png)\n\n    * To insert a QR code, select this type and enter the error correction rate to apply. This rate defines the quantity of information repeated and the tolerance to deterioration.\n\n      ![](assets/barcode_insert_06.png)\n\n      Example of a QR code:\n\n      ![](assets/barcode_insert_12.png)\n\n1. Enter the size of the barcode that you want to insert into the email: configuring the scale lets you increase or reduce the size of the barcode, from x1 to x10.\n1. The **[!UICONTROL Value]** field enables you to define the value of the barcode. A value can match a special offer and can be the function of a criteria, it can be the value of a database field linked to the customers.\n\n   This example shows an EAN-8 type barcode, to which was added the account number of a recipient. To add this account number, click the personalization button to the right of the **[!UICONTROL Value]** field and select **[!UICONTROL Recipient > Account number]**.\n\n   ![](assets/barcode_insert_15.png)\n\n1. The **[!UICONTROL Height]** field lets you configure the height of the barcode without changing its width, by altering the amount of space between each bar.\n\n   There is no restrictive entry control depending on the type of barcode. If a barcode value is incorrect, it will only be visible in **Preview** mode where the barcode will be crossed out in red.\n\n   >[!NOTE]\n   >\n   >The value assigned to a barcode depends on its type. For example, an EAN-8 type shall have exactly 8 numbers.\n   >\n   >The personalization button to the right of the **[!UICONTROL Value]** field lets you add data in addition to the value itself. This enriches the barcode, provided that the barcode standard accepts it.\n   >\n   >For example, if you are using a GS1-128 type barcode and want to enter the account number of a recipient in addition to the value, click the personalization button and select **[!UICONTROL Recipient > Account number]**. If the account number of the selected recipient is entered correctly, the barcode takes it into account.\n\nOnce these elements have been configured, you can finalize your email and send it. To avoid errors, always make sure your content is displayed correctly before performing a delivery by clicking the **[!UICONTROL Preview]** tab.\n\n![](assets/barcode_insert_10.png)\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>If the value of a barcode is incorrect, its bitmap is shown crossed out in red.\n\n![](assets/barcode_insert_11.png)\n","headers":[["title","Define the email content in Adobe Campaign Classic"],["description","Learn how to define the email content when using Adobe Campaign"],["feature","Email Design"]],"sections":[{"section":"Define the email content","sectionId":"c20e1848-ffa3-44dd-965f-9f919efcd748","paragraphs":[]},{"section":"Sender","sectionId":"01f4cb95-1d52-4aeb-8f64-b6db108b7df3","paragraphs":["To define the name and address of the sender which will appear in the header of messages sent, click the From link.","This window lets you enter all the information required to create the email message headers.
