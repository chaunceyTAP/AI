Edit the **[!UICONTROL Administration>Configuration>Data schemas]** node of the Adobe Campaign tree and click **[!UICONTROL New]** .\n1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Access data from an existing table or an SQL view]** option and click **[!UICONTROL Next]** .\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_extand_a_schema.png)\n\n1. Choose the table or the existing view:\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_select_table.png)\n\n1. Adapt the schema content to suit your needs.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_view_create_schema.png)\n\n   The schema must be populated with the view=\"true\" attribute on the `<srcSchema>` root element in order not to generate a table creation SQL script.\n\n**Example** :\n\n```\n<srcSchema name=\"recipient\" namespace=\"cus\" view=\"true\">\n  <element name=\"recipient\" sqltable=\"dbsrv.recipient\">\n    <key name=\"email\">\n      <keyfield xpath=\"@email\"/>\n    </key>   \n    <attribute name=\"email\" type=\"string\" length=\"80\" sqlname=\"email\"/>\n  </element>\n</srcSchema>\n```\n\n## Accessing an external database {#accessing-an-external-database}\n\nThe **Federated Data Access - FDA** option give you access to the data stored in an external database.\n\nThe configuration to be carried on the schemas to access data in an external database is detailed in [this page](../../installation/using/creating-data-schema.md).\n","headers":[["title","Schema of an existing table"],["description","Schema of an existing table"],["feature","Custom Resources"]],"sections":[{"section":"Schema of an existing table","sectionId":"4090a93a-6a02-4d6a-a328-22d5b6caba51","paragraphs":[]},{"section":"Overview","sectionId":"8ca97cd4-3b5f-4106-b4a9-bbba96f66e18","paragraphs":["When the application needs to access the data of an existing table, an SQL view, or data from a remote database, create its schema in Adobe Campaign with the following data:","Name of table: enter the name of the table (with its alias when a dblink is used) with the \"sqltable\" attribute, \nschema key: reference the reconciliation field(s),\nindexes: used to generate queries,\nThe fields and their location in the XML structure: fill in only the fields used in the application,\nlinks: if there are joins with the other tables of the base."]},{"section":"Implementation","sectionId":"041d0bf4-63b3-4b62-8144-32f84615f1a0","paragraphs":["To create the corresponding schema, apply the following stages:","Edit the Administration>Configuration>Data schemas node of the Adobe Campaign tree and click New .","Select the Access data from an existing table or an SQL view option and click Next .","Choose the table or the existing view:","Adapt the schema content to suit your needs.","The schema must be populated with the view=\"true\" attribute on the <srcSchema> root element in order not to generate a table creation SQL script.","Example :","<srcSchema name=\"recipient\" namespace=\"cus\" view=\"true\">\n  <element name=\"recipient\" sqltable=\"dbsrv.recipient\">\n    <key name=\"email\">\n      <keyfield xpath=\"@email\"/>\n    </key>   \n    <attribute name=\"email\" type=\"string\" length=\"80\" sqlname=\"email\"/>\n  </element>\n</srcSchema>"]},{"section":"Accessing an external database","sectionId":"ba41f4f2-94e8-4bd0-a621-4de1f555dc5d","paragraphs":["The Federated Data Access - FDA option give you access to the data stored in an external database.","The configuration to be carried on the schemas to access data in an external database is detailed in this page."]}]}
