Only the last work table is accessible. You can configure the workflow so that all work tables remain accessible: check the **[!UICONTROL Keep the result of interim populations between two executions]** option in the workflow properties.\n\nHowever, we recommend that you avoid activating this option in case of significant amounts of data. \n\n![](assets/wf-purge-data-option.png)\n\n## Target data {#target-data}\n\nThe data stored in the workflow's work table is accessible in the personalization fields.\n\nThis lets you use data collected via a list or based on answers to a survey in a delivery. To do this, use the following syntax:\n\n```\n%= targetData.FIELD %\n```\n\n**[!UICONTROL Target extension]** (targetData) type personalization elements are not available for targeting workflows. The delivery target has to be built in the workflow and specified in the inbound transition of the delivery.\n\nIf you want to create delivery proofs, the proof target needs to be built based on the **[!UICONTROL Address substitution]** mode so that the personalization data can be entered. For more on this, refer to this [section](../../delivery/using/steps-defining-the-target-population.md#using-address-substitution-in-proof).\n\nIn the following example, we are going to collect a list of information on customers, to be used in a personalized email.\n\nApply the following steps:\n\n1.

Configure the **[!UICONTROL Enrichment]** type activity to reconcile the collected data with that already in the Adobe Campaign database.\n\n   Here, the reconciliation key is the account number:\n\n   ![](assets/wf-targetdata-sample-3.png)\n\n1.
