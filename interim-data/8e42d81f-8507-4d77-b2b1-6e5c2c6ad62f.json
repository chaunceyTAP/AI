Learn how to ensure you continue to use Adobe Campaign Classic v7 without interruption. \n\n## What changed?\n\nAdobe Identity Management Service (IMS) stopped supporting old Internet Explorer versions on **June 30, 2021**. [Learn more](https://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/global/update-operating-system-and-browser.html). \n\nAdobe wants to preserve IMS functionality for all customers past June 30, 2021. IMS is part of the security framework which allows users to login to the Client Console, thus Adobe Campaign. \n\nTo preserve this functionality, customers must update the Client Console on each users’ machine, and ensure the latest update of your [Windows version](../../rn/using/compatibility-matrix.md#ClientConsoleoperatingsystems), with **Internet Explorer 11** built-in, is installed on each users’ machine. \n\n## Are you impacted?\n\nIf you are connecting to Campaign [via an Adobe ID](../../integrations/using/about-adobe-id.md), through Adobe Identity Management Service (IMS), and running an older version of Campaign than the ones listed below, you are impacted.\n\nIf you already upgraded but using an old version of Microsoft Internet Explorer, you must upgrade to Internet Explorer 11.\n\n## How to update?\n\n* As a hosted customer, Adobe already upgraded your instance(s) to the newer version.\n\n* As an on-premise/hybrid customer, you need to upgrade to one of the newer versions listed above to benefit from the new Client Console and ensure a seamless transition **before June 30, 2021**.\n\n    Upgrade to one of the new versions listed below is mandatory:\n\n    * Gold Standard 11. [Learn more](../../rn/using/gold-standard.md)\n    * Campaign 21.1.3 release. [Learn more](../../rn/using/latest-release.md)\n    * Campaign 20.2.5 release. \n    * Campaign 20.1.4 release. \n    * Campaign 19.2.4 release. \n\n    These releases come with a new connection protocol. Upgrade is mandatory for both Campaign server and Client Console: once all instances are upgraded, the Client Console needs to be upgraded to this version as well to be able to connect to Campaign after **June 30, 2021**.\n\nIn addition, ensure the latest update of your [Windows version](../../rn/using/compatibility-matrix.md#ClientConsoleoperatingsystems), with **Internet Explorer 11** built-in, is installed on each users’ machine. \n\n## FAQ\n\n**How can I check my Campaign version?**\n\nLearn how to check your version [in this section](../../platform/using/launching-adobe-campaign.md#getting-your-campaign-version).\n\n\n**How can I check if I use IMS?** \n\nTo check your connection mode, you can:\n\n* Launch Campaign Client Console and access your instance connection settings.
