The aim is to use some seed addresses: these seed addresses have the personalization field in their table but no value is saved there.\n\nTo use the random field substitution you must have:\n\n* a delivery with one or several personalization fields,\n* seed addresses whose **data schema** is modified according to the personalization fields used in the delivery.\n\n## Create a delivery {#step-1---creating-a-delivery}\n\nThe steps for creating a delivery are detailed in the [Create an email delivery](creating-an-email-delivery.md) section.\n\nIn this example, the delivery manager has created the newsletter.\n\n![](assets/dlv_seeds_usecase_24.png)\n\n## Edi the seed addresses data schema {#editing-the-seed-addresses-data-schema}\n\nThe instructions on how to modify a data schema are detailed in the section.\n\nIn this example, the seed addresses data schema takes a value created from the recipients data schema:\n\n```\n <attribute label=\"Favorite literary genre\" length=\"80\" name=\"favoriteLiteraryGenre\"\n               type=\"string\" userEnum=\"favoriteLiteraryGenre\"/>\n```\n\nThis enumeration lets the user specify the favorite literary genre of their clients.\n\nFor this data schema modification to be viewable in the seed addresses **Input form**, you must update it.

Configure your delivery list and your seed addresses. Refer to [Identify target populations](steps-defining-the-target-population.md).\n\n   In this example, the user selects users whose **favorite literary genre** is Sci-Fi as the main target population.\n\n   ![](assets/dlv_seeds_usecase_26.png)\n\n   The user adds seed addresses to the delivery.\n\n   ![](assets/dlv_seeds_usecase_27.png)\n\n   >[!NOTE]\n   >\n   >For more information on the **[!UICONTROL Edit the dynamic condition...]** link, refer to [Use case: select seed addresses on criteria](use-case-selecting-seed-addresses-on-criteria.md).\n\n1.
