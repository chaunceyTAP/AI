It is linked to a calendar period, has an allocated budget and can also be linked up to documents and objectives.\n\n  For more on this, refer to [Campaign calendar](../../campaign/using/accessing-marketing-campaigns.md#campaign-calendar).\n\n* **Workflow**\n\n  A campaign workflow contains the same activities as for all workflows but is specific to the campaign. It enables you to create and configure deliveries for all available channels.\n\n  For more on this, refer to [this section](../../campaign/using/marketing-campaign-deliveries.md#building-the-main-target-in-a-workflow).\n\n* **Objectives**\n\n  Within the campaign, program or plan, you can state a list of objectives. These are quantified values to be reached. At the end of the campaign, program or plan, the MRM module lets you compare the objectives and results in dedicated reports.\n\n* **Delivery outline**\n\n  A delivery outline is a structured description of a delivery. Every delivery can refer to a delivery outline which contains, for example, the related offers, documents to be attached, or a link to stores. An offer can be referenced in the delivery according to the delivery outline selected.\n\n  For more on this, refer to [this section](../../campaign/using/marketing-campaign-deliveries.md#associating-and-structuring-resources-linked-via-a-delivery-outline).\n\n## Tutorial {#video}\n\nThis video presents the key concepts of marketing campaigns.\n\n>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/35131?quality=12)\n\nAdditional Campaign Classic how-to videos are available [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic-learn/tutorials/overview.html).\n","headers":[["title","Design and execute marketing campaigns"],["description","Define, optimize, execute and analyse marketing campaigns"],["feature","Campaigns"]],"sections":[{"section":"Design and execute marketing campaigns","sectionId":"99e2a80b-5c82-4c6d-992e-20e4155b7c43","paragraphs":["Adobe Campaign lets you define, optimize, execute and analyze communications and marketing campaigns.
