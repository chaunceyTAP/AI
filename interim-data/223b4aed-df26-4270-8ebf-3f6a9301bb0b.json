The pipeline retrieves users' actions or triggers from your website. A cart abandonment is an example of trigger. Triggers are processed in Adobe Campaign to send emails in near real time.\n\n>[!CAUTION]\n>\n>This capability is not available out of the box as part of the product. For this implementation, work with your Adobe representative / Customer Care. You will then be able to follow the steps detailed in this [page](../../integrations/using/configuring-pipeline.md#prerequisites).\n\n[!DNL Triggers] run marketing actions within a short range of time following a user's action. The typical response time is less than one hour.\n\nIt allows for more agile integrations since the configuration is minimal and a third party is not involved.\nIt also supports high volumes of traffic without impacting the performance of marketing activities. As an example, the integration can process a million triggers per hour.\n\n![](assets/do-not-localize/book.png) Discover how to [create an Experience Cloud trigger](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-cloud/triggers/create.html) and identify, define, and monitor critical consumer behaviors.\n\n## [!DNL Triggers] architecture {#triggers-architecture}\n\nThe [!DNL pipelined] process is always running on the Adobe Campaign marketing server. It connects to the pipeline, retrieves the events, and processes them immediately.\n\n![](assets/triggers_2.png)\n\nThe [!DNL pipelined] process logs in to the Experience Cloud using an authentication service and sends a private key. The authentication service returns a token. The token is used to authenticate when retrieving the events.\n\n## Prerequisites {#adobe-io-prerequisites}\n\nBefore starting this implementation, please check you have:\n\n* a valid **Organization identifier**: the Organization ID is the unique identifier within the Adobe Experience Cloud, used for example for the VisitorID service and the IMS Single-Sign On (SSO). [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/core-services/interface/administration/organizations.html)\n* a **Developer access** to your Organization. The System administrator of the organization needs to follow the **Add developers to a single product profile** procedure detailed [in this page](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/manage-developers.html) to provide developer access for the `Analytics - {tenantID}` Product Profile of the Adobe Analytics Product associated with Triggers.\n\n## Implementation steps {#implement}\n\nTo implement Campaign and Experience Cloud Triggers, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Create an OAuth project. [Learn more](oauth-technical-account.md#oauth-service)\n\n1. Add your OAuth project credentials in Adobe Campaign. [Learn more](oauth-technical-account.md#add-credentials)\n\n1. Update the authentication type to the Developer console project in the configuration file **config-<&nbsp;instance-name&nbsp;>.xml** as follows:\n\n    ```\n    <pipelined ... authType=\"imsJwtToken\"  ... />\n    ```\n\n    Then, run a `config -reload` and a restart of the [!DNL pipelined] for the changes to be taken into account.\n\n","headers":[["title","About Adobe Experience Cloud Triggers"],["description","Get started with Adobe Experience Cloud Triggers implementation"],["feature","Triggers"]],"sections":[{"section":"Work with Campaign and Experience Cloud Triggers","sectionId":"ea6eb3a3-87a9-4ba3-9e00-70e64b995743","paragraphs":["DNL Triggers is an integration between Adobe Campaign and Adobe Analytics using the pipeline.
