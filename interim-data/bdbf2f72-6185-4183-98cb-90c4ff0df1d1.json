For more information on Adobe Campaign Classic built-in packages, refer to this [page](../../installation/using/installing-campaign-standard-packages.md).\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL Change data source]** activity allows you to change the data source of a workflow **[!UICONTROL Working table]**. This provides more flexibility to manage data across different data sources such as FDA, FFDA and local database.\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL Working table]** allows Adobe Campaign Classic workflow to handle data and share data with the workflow activities.\nBy default, the **[!UICONTROL Working table]** is created in the same database as the source of the data we query on.\n\nFor example, when querying the **[!UICONTROL Profiles]** table, stored on the Cloud database, you will create a **[!UICONTROL Working table]** on the same Cloud database.\nTo change this, you can add the **[!UICONTROL Change Data Source]** activity to choose a different data source for your **[!UICONTROL Working table]**.\n\nNote that when using the **[!UICONTROL Change Data Source]** activity, you will need to switch back to the Cloud database to continue the workflow execution.\n\nTo use the **[!UICONTROL Change Data Source]** activity:\n\n1. Create a workflow.\n\n1. Query your targeted recipients with a **[!UICONTROL Query]** activity. \n\n    For more information on the **[!UICONTROL Query]** activity, refer to this [page](../../workflow/using/query.md#creating-a-query).\n\n1. From the **[!UICONTROL Targeting]** tab, add a **[!UICONTROL Change data source]** activity.\n\n   ![](assets/change-data-source.png)\n\n1. Double-click your **[!UICONTROL Change data source]** activity to select **[!UICONTROL Default data source]**.\n    \n    The working table, which contains the result of your query, is then moved to the default PostgreSQL database.\n\n   ![](assets/change-data-source_2.png)\n\n1. From the **[!UICONTROL Actions]** tab, drag and drop a **[!UICONTROL JavaScript code]** activity to perform unitary operations on the working table.\n\n    For more information on the **[!UICONTROL JavaScript code]** activity, refer to the [JavaScript code and Advanced JavaScript code](../../workflow/using/sql-code-and-javascript-code.md#javascript-code) page.\n\n1. Add another **[!UICONTROL Change data source]** activity to switch back to the Cloud database. \n    \n1. Double-click your activity and select **[!UICONTROL Active FDA external account]** then the corresponding **[!UICONTROL External database]** external account.\n\n   ![](assets/change-data-source_3.png)\n\n1. You can now start your workflow.\n","headers":[["title","Change data source"],["description","Learn more about the Change data source activity"],["feature","Workflows, Data Management, Federated Data Access"]],"sections":[{"section":"Change data source","sectionId":"51ddaf78-ab49-4dd5-bffe-37a22cf1b5fd","paragraphs":["NOTE","The Change data source activity is only available with the Access to external data (Federated Data Access) package.
