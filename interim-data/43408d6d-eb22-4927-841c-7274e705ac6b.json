[Learn more in this page](../../integrations/using/about-adobe-id.md).\n>\n\n## Linking your solutions {#working-with-experience-cloud-solutions}\n\nMultiple solutions can be linked to Adobe Experience Cloud. The **organization** is the customer entity that enables an administrator to configure groups and users, and to control single sign-on (SSO) in Adobe Experience Cloud. The organization acts like a log-in company that spans all the Experience Cloud products and solutions. Most often, an organization is your company name. However, a company can have many organizations.\n\nOrganization management and linking Adobe Experience Cloud accounts are detailed in the [Adobe Experience Cloud help portal](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/core-services/interface/administration/organizations){_blank}. \n\n## Identity and cookie management {#id-and-cookies}\n\nWhen installing Adobe Campaign or integrating an existing installation with Adobe Experience Cloud, the [Adobe Experience Cloud Identity Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/id-service/using/home){_blank} is enabled. This service replaces the permanent cookie used first and foremost by Adobe Campaign for its tracking functionalities.\n\nThe Adobe Experience Cloud Identity Service (ID service) provides a universal, persistent ID that identifies your visitors across all the solutions in the Experience Cloud.\n\nA unique visitor ID will be assigned to recipients generating tracking logs. This ID will be saved in the **[!UICONTROL Requester UUID (@sourceID)]** field of the **[!UICONTROL nms:trackingLogRcp]** table. **The tracking data of recipients who existed before the visitor ID service was implemented will therefore no longer be usable**.\n\nThe ID will then be recognized by the other Adobe Experience Cloud solutions with the same CNAME.
