To do this, click the **[!UICONTROL Explorer]** button in the toolbar.\n\nBy default, recipients are stored in the **[!UICONTROL Profiles and targets]** node of the Adobe Campaign tree. From the same node, you can create one or more folders and sub-folders to store recipient profiles.\n\nEach node coincides with a folder. The data from each folder must be considered to be partitioned from each other. This means that the management of doubles will be trickier for multiple recipient folders.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>To display the list of all recipients in the database, you must create a view. Learn more in [Folders and views](../../platform/using/access-management-folders.md).\n\n## Move recipients {#moving-recipients}\n\nYou can select one or more recipients, drag them from the recipient list, and drop them in the desired folder. A warning message asks you to confirm this action.\n\n## Copy a recipient {#copying-a-recipient}\n\nYou can copy a recipient in the same folder by right-clicking the desired recipient and selecting **[!UICONTROL Copy]**.\n\n## Delete recipients {#deleting-recipients}\n\nTo delete recipients, move them to a specific folder and then purge the content of this folder. It is **strongly recommended not to use** the **[!UICONTROL Delete]** option in this case.\n\nTo purge a folder, use the **[!UICONTROL Actions > Purge folder]** menu, accessed by right-clicking the desired folder.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_purge_folder.png)\n\nClick **[!UICONTROL Start]** to launch the operation.
