Stop all services - [Learn more](#service-stop).\n1. Save the database - [Learn more](#back-up-the-database).\n1. Uninstall previous Adobe Campaign version packages - [Learn more](#uninstalling-adobe-campaign-previous-version-packages).\n1. Migrate the platform - [Learn more](#deploying-adobe-campaign-v7).\n1. Re-start service - [Learn more](#re-starting-services).\n\n## Service stop {#service-stop}\n\nFirst, stop all processes with access to the database on all machines concerned.\n\n1. Log in as **root**.\n1. All servers which use the redirection module (**webmdl** service) need to be stopped. For Apache, run the following command:\n\n   ```\n   /etc/init.d/apache2 stop\n   ```\n\n1. Log in again as **root**.\n1. Stop Adobe Campaign previous version services on all servers.\n\n   ```\n   /etc/init.d/nlserver6 stop\n   ```\n\n<!--\n   If you are migrating from v5.11, run the following command:\n\n   ```\n   /etc/init.d/nlserver5 stop\n   ```\n\n-->\n\n1. Make sure Adobe Campaign services are stopped on each server.\n\n   ```\n   ps waux | grep nlserver\n   ```\n\n   The list of active processes is displayed along with their ID (PID).\n\n1. If one or more Adobe Campaign processes are still active or blocked after a few minutes, kill them.\n\n   ```\n   killall nlserver\n   ```\n\n1. If some processes are still active after a few minutes, you can force them to close using the command:\n\n   ```\n   killall -9 nlserver\n   ```\n\n## Back up your database {#back-up-the-database}\n\n<!--\n\n### For Adobe Campaign v5.11 {#migrating-from-adobe-campaign-v5-11}\n\n1. Make a backup of the Adobe Campaign database. \n1.

Edit the **config-`<instance name>`.xml** (in the **nl5.back** folder), to prevent the **mta**, **wfserver**, **stat** etc. services from starting automatically. For instance, replace **autoStart** with **_autoStart** (still as **neolane**).\n\n   ```\n   <?xml version='1.0'?>\n   <serverconf>\n     <shared>\n       <dataStore hosts=\"myServer*\" lang=\"en_US\">\n         <dataSource name=\"default\">\n           <dbcnx encrypted=\"1\" login=\"myLogin\" password=\"myPassword\"  provider=\"postgresql\" server=\"myServer\"/>\n         </dataSource>\n       </dataStore>\n     </shared>\n   \n     <mta _autoStart=\"true\" statServerAddress=\"myStatServer\"/>\n     <stat _autoStart=\"true\"/>\n     <wfserver _autoStart=\"true\"/>\n     <inMail _autoStart=\"true\"/>\n     <sms _autoStart=\"false\"/>\n   </serverconf>\n   ```\n\n-->\n\n<!--\n\n### For Adobe Campaign v6.02 {#migrating-from-adobe-campaign-v6-02}\n\n1. Make a backup of the Adobe Campaign database. \n1.
