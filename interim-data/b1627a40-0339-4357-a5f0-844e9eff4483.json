This query concerns all deliveries.\n\nThis example also shows how to configure a filter related to the choice of a collection element (or orange node). Collection elements are available in the **[!UICONTROL Field to select]** window.\n\n* Which table needs to be selected?\n\n  The recipient table (**nms:recipient**)\n\n* Fields to be selected for the output column\n\n  Primary key, Last name, First name and Email\n\n* Based on which criteria is the information filtered\n\n  Based on the delivery logs of recipients going back 7 days before today\n\nApply the following steps:\n\n1. Open the Generic query editor and select the Recipient table **[!UICONTROL (nms:recipient)]**.\n1. In the **[!UICONTROL Data to extract]** window, select **[!UICONTROL Primary key]**, **[!UICONTROL First name]**, **[!UICONTROL Last name]** and **[!UICONTROL Email]**.\n\n   ![](assets/query_editor_nveau_33.png)\n\n1. In the sorting window, sort the names alphabetically.\n\n   ![](assets/query_editor_nveau_34.png)\n\n1. In the **[!UICONTROL Data filtering]** window, select **[!UICONTROL Filtering conditions]**.\n1. In the **[!UICONTROL Target element]** window, the filtering condition for extracting profiles with no tracking log for the last 7 days involves two steps. The element you need to select is a many-to-many link.\n\n    * Start by selecting the **[!UICONTROL Recipient delivery logs (broadlog)]** collection element (orange node) for the first **[!UICONTROL Value]** column.\n    \n      ![](assets/query_editor_nveau_67.png)\n\n      Choose the **[!UICONTROL do not exist as]** operator. There is no need to select a second value in this line.\n    \n    * The content of the second filtering condition depends on the first. Here, the **[!UICONTROL Event date]** field is offered directly in the **[!UICONTROL Recipient delivery logs]** table since there is a link to this table.\n    \n      ![](assets/query_editor_nveau_36.png)\n\n      Select **[!UICONTROL Event date]** with the **[!UICONTROL greater than or equal to]** operator. Select the **[!UICONTROL DaysAgo (7)]** value. To do this, click **[!UICONTROL Edit expression]** in the **[!UICONTROL Value]** field. In the **[!UICONTROL Formula type]** window, select **[!UICONTROL Process on dates]** and **[!UICONTROL Current date minus n days]**, giving \"7\" as a value.\n    \n      ![](assets/query_editor_nveau_37.png)\n\n      The filter condition is configured.\n    \n      ![](assets/query_editor_nveau_38.png)\n\n1. In the **[!UICONTROL Data formatting]** window, switch the last names to upper-case. Click the **[!UICONTROL Last name]** line in the **[!UICONTROL Transformation]** column and select **[!UICONTROL Switch to upper case]** in the drop-down menu.\n\n   ![](assets/query_editor_nveau_39.png)\n\n1. Use the **[!UICONTROL Add a calculated field]** function to insert a column into the data preview window.\n\n   In this example, add a calculated field with the first and last names of the recipients in a single column. Click the **[!UICONTROL Add a calculated field]** function. In the **[!UICONTROL Export calculated field definition]** window, enter a label and an internal name and choose the **[!UICONTROL JavaScript Expression]** type. Then enter the following expression:\n\n   ```\n   var rep = source._firstName+\" - \"+source._lastName\n   return rep\n   ```\n\n   ![](assets/query_editor_nveau_40.png)\n\n   Click **[!UICONTROL OK]**. The **[!UICONTROL Data formatting]** window is configured.\n\n   For more on adding calculated fields, refer to this section.\n\n1. The result is shown in the **[!UICONTROL Data preview]** window. Recipients which not have been contacted in the last 7 days are displayed in alphabetical order. Names are displayed in upper case and the column with first and last names has been created.\n\n   ![](assets/query_editor_nveau_41.png)\n","headers":[["title","Query using a many-to-many relationship"],["description","Learn how to perform queries using a many-to-many relationship"],["feature","Query Editor, Workflows"]],"sections":[{"section":"Query using a many-to-many relationship","sectionId":"69cd3f35-3c9d-4e7d-b997-9ead2f567fdc","paragraphs":["In this example, we want to recover recipients not contacted during the last 7 days.
