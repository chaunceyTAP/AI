For more on these regulations, see [this section](privacy-management.md#privacy-management-regulations).\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>The opt-out for the Sale of Personal Information, which is specific to CCPA, is explained in [this section](#sale-of-personal-information-ccpa).\n\n<!--Installation procedures described in this document are applicable starting Campaign Classic 18.4 (build 8931+). If you are running on a previous version, refer to this [technote](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/how-to-install-gdpr-package-on-legacy-versions.html).-->\n\nIn order to help you facilitate your Privacy readiness, Adobe Campaign allows you to handle Access and Delete requests. The **Right to Access** and the **Right to be Forgotten** (delete request) are described in [this section](privacy-management.md#right-access-forgotten).\n\nAdobe Campaign offers Data Controllers two possibilities for performing Privacy Access and Delete requests:\n\n* Via the **Adobe Campaign interface**: for each Privacy request, the Data Controller creates a new privacy request in Adobe Campaign. See [this section](privacy-requests-ui.md).\n* Via the **API**: Adobe Campaign provides an API that allows the automatic process of Privacy requests using SOAP. See [this section](privacy-requests-api.md).\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>For more on personal data and on the different entities that manage data (Data Controller, Data Processor and Data Subject), see [Personal data and Personas](privacy-and-recommendations.md#personal-data).\n\n## Prerequisites {#prerequesites}\n\nAdobe Campaign offers Data Controllers tools to create and process Privacy requests for data stored in Adobe Campaign. However, it is the Data Controller's responsibility to handle the relationship with the Data Subject (email, customer care or a web portal).\n\nIt is therefore your responsibility as a Data Controller to confirm the identity of the Data Subject making the request and to confirm that the data returned to the requester is about the Data Subject.\n\n## Installing the Privacy package {#install-privacy-package}\n\nIn order to use this feature, you need to install the **[!UICONTROL Privacy Data Protection Regulation]** package via the **[!UICONTROL Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Advanced]** > **[!UICONTROL Import package]** > **[!UICONTROL Adobe Campaign Package]** menu. For more information on how to install packages, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../installation/using/installing-campaign-standard-packages.md).\n\nTwo new folders, specific to Privacy, are created under **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Platform]**:\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Privacy Requests]**: this is where you will create your Privacy requests and track their evolution.\n* **[!UICONTROL Namespaces]**: this is where you will define the field that will be used to identify the Data Subject in the Adobe Campaign database.\n\n![](assets/privacy-folders.png)\n\nIn **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Production]** > **[!UICONTROL Technical workflows]**, three technical workflows run every day to process Privacy requests.\n\n![](assets/privacy-workflows.png)\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Collect privacy requests]**: this workflow generates the recipient's data stored in Adobe Campaign and makes it available for download in the privacy request's screen.\n* **[!UICONTROL Delete privacy requests data]**: this workflow deletes the recipient's data stored in Adobe Campaign.\n* **[!UICONTROL Privacy request cleanup]**: this workflow erases the access request files that are older than 90 days.\n\nIn **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Access Management]** > **[!UICONTROL Named rights]**, the **[!UICONTROL Privacy Data Right]** named right has been added. This named right is required for Data Controllers in order for them to use privacy tools. This allows them to create new requests, track their evolution, use the API, etc.\n\n![](assets/privacy-right.png)\n\n## Namespaces {#namesspaces}\n\nBefore creating Privacy requests, you need to define the namespace you will use. This is the key that will be used to identify the Data Subject in the Adobe Campaign database.\n\nThree namespaces are available out-of-the-box: email, phone and mobile phone. If you need a different namespace (a recipient custom field, for example), you can create a new one from **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Platform]** > **[!UICONTROL Namespaces]**.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>For optimal performance, it is recommended to use out-of-the-box namespaces.\n","headers":[["title","Manage Privacy requests"],["description","Learn about Privacy requests"],["feature","Privacy, Privacy Tools"],["topic-tags","starting-with-adobe-campaign"]],"sections":[{"section":"About Privacy requests","sectionId":"dfd95e0a-77c0-4aef-9a0d-b355b71b71fd","paragraphs":["For a general presentation on Privacy Management, refer to this section.","This information applies to GDPR, CCPA, PDPA, and LGPD.
