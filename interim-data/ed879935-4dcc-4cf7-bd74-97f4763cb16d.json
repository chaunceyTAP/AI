You should work with your own legal counsel to ensure they are taking all steps necessary towards GDPR, CCPA, PDPA, LGPD or any other applicable regulation readiness.\n\n**Prepare for data Access and Delete requests**\n\n* Identify a process to receive/respond to Data Subject requests, including appointing a Privacy point of contact.\n\n* Review the various customer data stored in Adobe Campaign and determine unique identifiers (there will likely be more than one).\n\n* Determine a validation/authentication policy and process for Data Subject identity confirmation.\n\n* Make sure that the Data Subject response is easy to understand.\n\n**Consider Consent**\n\n* List and update as necessary all touch points for data capture for GDPR (i.e. consider language, mechanism for consent, and consent logs).\n\n* Make sure all marketing emails include the unsubscribe links.\n\n* Assess global strategy for email marketing to determine geo-specific implementations.\n\n**Understand your data**\n\n* Review all data import and capture sources where data is flowing into Adobe Campaign, and document which fields are being used for your marketing efforts.\n\n* Remove any unused data attributes from your Adobe Campaign database.\n\n* Use data available in Adobe Campaign for the intent it was captured and give your recipients better personalized experiences.\n\n* Review and update data access permissions to help ensure users of Adobe Campaign can fully leverage only the data needed to run their campaigns, but not access any data beyond this.\n\n* Ensure each user of Adobe Campaign has the appropriate access rights to perform their required tasks, but does not have any other rights to perform additional tasks.\n\n## Preserve user engagement {#preserve-user-engagement}\n\n### How could Data Controllers obtain consent with minimal impact on user engagement?\n\nIn those instances where consent will be needed for certain marketing activities, consumer consent will need to be active (i.e. no silence as assent or pre-checked boxes), unbundled, and it may not be conditional upon offering the services.\n\nThere may even be instances where certain consents need to be refreshed to be able to continue using data going forward.\n\nMarketers should embrace these enhanced consent requirements as a true indicator of brand engagement and loyalty, as well as customer satisfaction and trust.\n\n## Manage consent {#manage-consent}\n\n### How can Data Controllers manage consent in Adobe Campaign?\n\nAdobe Campaign already provides capabilities to manage consent at more levels than most marketers leverage via customized data fields or through one or more services.\n\nMarketers should check with their legal counsel for guidance on how to proceed, and then take advantage of capabilities already built-in to Adobe Campaign.\n\nFor example, extending the data model in Adobe Campaign to track not only if people have opted-in, but also the timestamp of the opt-in, and some type of indicator that captures the precise scope of consent.\n\n## Data deletion {#data-deletion}\n\n### What data can Data Controllers delete in Adobe Campaign in response to a customer request by a Data Subject?\n\nAll data associated to the Data Subject will be deleted including out-of-the-box and custom tables.\n\nTechnically, all data linked to the Data Subject with `integrity=\"own\"` will be deleted.\n\nAs the Data Controller, you have the option of customizing this by changing the integrity of links defined in the data schemas (for example, in case you have a business justification to not delete certain data).\n\n### How are reports affected when delivery and tracking logs are deleted?\n\nReports in Adobe Campaign are based on indicators computed on aggregated data from delivery and tracking logs. As a result, removing the individual logs should not impact the metrics displayed on the reports.\n\n## Re-import data {#re-import-data}\n\n### Do I need to be mindful of possibly re-importing data at a later date?\n\nOften in Adobe Campaign, record is uploaded from an external data source.\n\nAs the Data Controller you will need to ensure that when you receive a deletion request, you delete all necessary data about the Data Subject from all of your systems.\n\n## Opt in again {#opt-in-again}\n\n### Can a Data Subject, whose data has been erased from Adobe Campaign, opt in again later?\n\nIt is possible for a Data Subject to opt-in again or to be added as a new recipient after their data has been erased from Adobe Campaign.\n\nYou can use the audit trail which details when the previous deletion was performed and when the new recipient has been created.\n","headers":[["title","Privacy and Consent FAQ"],["description","Privacy and Consent FAQ"],["feature","Privacy, Privacy Tools"],["topic-tags","starting-with-adobe-campaign"]],"sections":[{"section":"Privacy FAQ","sectionId":"f1626ac7-8df9-496d-aa50-69903401727a","paragraphs":["Here are some of the Frequently Asked Questions about Privacy and Consent when using Adobe Campaign."]},{"section":"Key terms","sectionId":"af2cb732-79ba-44c0-9894-609c0d4017bf","paragraphs":[]},{"section":"What are the key terms about Privacy?","sectionId":"b5bbaca8-059c-4084-bf96-294a3cefd409","paragraphs":["The items listed below link to the key terms and concepts related to Privacy and Consent in Adobe Campaign:","Regulations on Privacy management\nPersonal Data and Personas\nRight to Access and Right to be Forgotten\nConsent, Retention and Roles"]},{"section":"Privacy regulations readiness","sectionId":"a2fe2823-21f1-4ebe-913b-703372c45511","paragraphs":[]},{"section":"What is Adobe Campaign's suggestion to comply with the most recent Privacy regulations?","sectionId":"83ef53fa-d6a6-44b9-9c56-02aca7ec2d0c","paragraphs":["Adobe does not provide legal advice.
