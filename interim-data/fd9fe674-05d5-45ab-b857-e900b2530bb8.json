Creating a workflow to recover answers to the survey and store them in a list.\n1. Creating a cube using the data in the list.\n1. Creating a report with the pivot table and viewing the breakdown of answers.\n\nBefore starting on this use case, you need to have access to a survey and a set of answers that you can analyze.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>This use case may only be implemented if you have acquired the **Survey Manager** option. Please check your license agreement.\n\n## Step 1 - Creating the data collection and storage workflow {#step-1---creating-the-data-collection-and-storage-workflow}\n\nTo collect the answers to the survey, apply the following steps:\n\n1. Create a workflow and place an **[!UICONTROL Answers to a survey]** activity. For more on using this activity, refer to [this section](../../surveys/using/publish-track-and-use-collected-data.md#using-the-collected-data).\n1. Edit the activity and select the survey whose answers you want to analyze.\n1. Enable the **[!UICONTROL Select all the answer data]** option to collect all the information.\n\n   ![](../../surveys/using/assets/reporting_usecase_1_01.png)\n\n1. Select the columns to extract (in this case: select: all archived fields. These are the fields that contain the answers.\n\n   ![](../../surveys/using/assets/reporting_usecase_1_02.png)\n\n1. Once the answer collection box is configured, position a **[!UICONTROL List update]** type activity to save the data.\n\n   ![](../../surveys/using/assets/reporting_usecase_1_04.png)\n\n   In this activity, specify the list to be updated and un-check the **[!UICONTROL Purge and re-use the list if it exists (otherwise add to the list)]** option: answers are added to the existing table. This option will enable you to reference the list in a cube. The schema linked to the list will not be re-generated for each update, which guarantees the integrity of the cube that uses this list.\n\n   ![](../../surveys/using/assets/reporting_usecase_1_03.png)\n\n1. Start the workflow to confirm its configuration.\n\n   ![](../../surveys/using/assets/reporting_usecase_1_05.png)\n\n   The specified list is created and includes the schema of the answers to the survey.\n\n1. Add a scheduler to automate the daily collection of answers and the list update.\n\n   The **[!UICONTROL List update]** and **[!UICONTROL Scheduler]** activities are detailed in .\n\n## Step 2 - Creating the cube, its measures and its indicators {#step-2---creating-the-cube--its-measures-and-its-indicators}\n\nYou may then create the cube and configure its measures: they will be used to create the indicators that will be shown in the report. For more on creating and configuring cubes, refer to [About cubes](../../reporting/using/ac-cubes.md).\n\nIn this example, the cube is based on the data in the list fed by the workflow created previously.\n\n![](../../surveys/using/assets/reporting_usecase_2_01.png)\n\nDefine the dimensions and the measures to be displayed in the report. Here, we want to display the contract date and the country of the respondent.\n\n![](../../surveys/using/assets/reporting_usecase_2_02.png)\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL Preview]** tab lets you control the rendering of the report.\n\n## Step 3 - Creating the report and configuring the data layout within the table {#step-3---creating-the-report-and-configuring-the-data-layout-within-the-table}\n\nYou may then create a report based on this cube and process the data and information.\n\n![](../../surveys/using/assets/reporting_usecase_3_01.png)\n\nAdapt the information to display based on your needs.\n\n![](../../surveys/using/assets/reporting_usecase_3_02.png)\n",
