This means that some TCP ports need to be open for these processes.\n\nUse the embedded Apache Tomcat port as a priority (8080 by default) for internal communications between the various application servers of an Adobe Campaign platform.\n\n### Delivery server {#delivery-server}\n\nFor the delivery server (**nlserver mta**), the following ports must be open:\n\n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td> Ports<br /> </td> \n   <td> Destination<br /> </td> \n   <td> Comments<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> 25/tcp (smtp)<br /> </td> \n   <td> Anywhere<br /> </td> \n   <td> SMTP traffic for email broadcasting.<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> 53/udp (domain)<br /> </td> \n   <td> DNS servers<br /> </td> \n   <td> DNS queries.<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> 38000/tcp (default port)<br /> </td> \n   <td> SMS gateway<br /> </td> \n   <td> Used to send SMS traffic to the NetSize SMS router [option].<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> 7777/udp<br /> </td> \n   <td> Statistics server<br /> </td> \n   <td> Accessing the statistics server.<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table>\n\n### Inbound mail {#inbound-mail}\n\nFor the inbound mail recovery process (**nlserver inMail**), the following ports must be open:\n\n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td> Ports<br /> </td> \n   <td> Destination<br /> </td> \n   <td> Comments<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> 110/tcp (pop3)<br /> </td> \n   <td> Internal mail server<br /> </td> \n   <td> POP3 traffic to pick up bounce messages.<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> 25/tcp (smtp)<br /> </td> \n   <td> Internal mail server<br /> </td> \n   <td> SMTP traffic to send remaining bounce messages that are not automatically processed by the pre-defined rules.<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table>\n\n### Application server {#application-server}\n\nFor the application server (**nlserver web**), the following ports must be open:\n\n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td> Ports<br /> </td> \n   <td> Destination<br /> </td> \n   <td> Comments<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> 80/tcp (http)<br /> 443/tcp (https)<br /> </td> \n   <td> Anywhere<br /> </td> \n   <td> HTTP or HTTPS traffic (including for the deliverability offer).<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table>\n\nWhen several application servers of an Adobe Campaign platform need to communicate with each other, we recommend using the port of the Apache Tomcat server (by default: 8080) rather than that of the HTTP port of the Web server which redirection module integration was carried out with. This means the port needs to be open between these servers.\n\n### SMS delivery status {#sms-delivery-status}\n\nTo track SMS deliveries (**nlserver sms**), the following port must be open:\n\n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td> Ports<br /> </td> \n   <td> Destination<br /> </td> \n   <td> Comments<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> 38000/tcp (default port)<br /> </td> \n   <td> SMS gateway<br /> </td> \n   <td> Queries the delivery queue status managed by the NetSize SMS gateway [option].<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table>\n\n### Rich client {#rich-client}\n\nFor the Adobe Campaign rich client (**nlclient**), the following ports must be open:\n\n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td> Ports<br /> </td> \n   <td> Destination<br /> </td> \n   <td> Comments<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p> 80/tcp (http)</p><p>443/tcp (https)</p><br /> </td> \n   <td> Application server<br /> </td> \n   <td> SOAP traffic (HTTP).<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table>\n\n## Database access {#database-access}\n\nAll components that use the database must be able to connect to it. This is the case for most components, with the exception of the redirection server, which can work alone, and the thin Win32 client, which uses HTTP (or HTTPS) only to communicate with the application server.\n\nThe default ports are the following: \n\n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td> Database type<br /> </td> \n   <td> Port (default)<br /> </td> \n   <td> Destination<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> <strong>Oracle</strong><br /> </td> \n   <td> 1521/tcp<br /> </td> \n   <td> Database server<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> <strong>PostgreSQL</strong><br /> </td> \n   <td> 5432/tcp<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> <strong>Microsoft SQL Server</strong><br /> </td> \n   <td> 1433/tcp<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table>\n\n## External access {#external-access}\n\nIn addition, certain components must be accessible from the public internet so that email campaigns executed directly from Adobe Campaign can be viewed. This means that some ports need to be open for components.\n\n### Redirection server {#redirection-server}\n\n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td> Listening port<br /> </td> \n   <td> Location<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p> 80/tcp (http)</p><p> 443/tcp (https)</p><br /> </td> \n   <td> Anywhere.

For more information on configuring this integration, refer to the [detailed documentation](../../integrations/using/about-adobe-experience-manager.md).\n\n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td> Listening port<br /> </td> \n   <td> Description<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> 80<br /> </td> \n   <td> AEM connection to Adobe Campaign<br /> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p> 4502</p><p> 4503</p><br /> </td> \n   <td> Adobe Campaign connection to AEM's \"authoring\" and \"publishing\" instances.

It is almost always outbound and much in demand during email broadcasts. Here are a few examples of configurations based on our experience:\n\n* 1 Mb/s for 10,000 emails per hour (average size of 30 Kb)\n* 8 to 10 Mb/s for 100,000 emails per hour (average size of 30 Kb)\n\nIf you have constraints in terms of bandwidth, it is possible to schedule campaigns to run during the night when demand is lower.\n","headers":[["title","Network configuration"],["description","Learn system communication guidelines"],["feature","Installation, Instance Settings"],["topic-tags","prerequisites-and-recommendations-"]],"sections":[{"section":"Network configuration","sectionId":"b72e18e6-a7ba-4824-8b3d-1c9cb19088f4","paragraphs":[]},{"section":"Communication between processes","sectionId":"1a91ee1f-2b32-426e-8eb2-e5b45f6403f7","paragraphs":["Certain processes of the application need to communicate with others or to access the LAN and internet.
