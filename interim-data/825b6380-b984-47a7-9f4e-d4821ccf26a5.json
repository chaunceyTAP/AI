In that case, the global throughput will be the relay one (provided that the relay server throughput is inferior to the Adobe Campaign one).\n\nIn this case, these parameters are set by configuring the SMTP server in the **`<relay>`** section. You must specify the IP address (or host) of the SMTP server used to transfer mail and its associated port (25 by default).\n\n```\n<relay address=\"192.0.0.3\" port=\"25\"/>\n```\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n>\n>This operating mode implies serious limitations on deliveries, as it can greatly reduce the throughput because of the relay server intrinsic performances (latency, bandwidth...). Moreover, the capacity to qualify synchronous delivery errors (detected by analyzing SMTP traffic) will be limited, and the sending will not be possible if the relay server is not available.\n\n## MTA child processes {#mta-child-processes}\n\nIt is possible to control the number of child processes (maxSpareServers by default 2) in order to optimize broadcast performance according to the CPU power of the servers and the available network resources. This configuration is to be made in the **`<master>`** section of MTA configuration on each individual computer.\n\n```\n<master dataBasePoolPeriodSec=\"30\" dataBaseRetryDelaySec=\"60\" maxSpareServers=\"2\" minSpareServers=\"0\" startSpareServers=\"0\">\n```\n\nAlso refer to [Email sending optimization](../../installation/using/email-deliverability.md#email-sending-optimization).\n\n## Manage outbound SMTP traffic with affinities {#managing-outbound-smtp-traffic-with-affinities}\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n>\n>The affinity configuration needs to be consistent from one server to another. We recommend that you contact Adobe for affinity configuration, as configuration changes should be replicated on all application servers running the MTA.\n\nYou can improve outbound SMTP traffic through affinities with IP addresses.\n\nTo do this, apply the following steps:\n\n1. Enter the affinities in the **`<ipaffinity>`** section of the **serverConf.xml** file.\n\n   One affinity can have several different names: to separate them, use the **;** character.\n\n   Example:\n\n   ```\n    IPAffinity name=\"mid.Server;WWserver;local.Server\">\n             <IP address=\"XX.XXX.XX.XX\" heloHost=\"myserver.us.campaign.net\" publicId=\"123\" excludeDomains=\"neo.*\" weight=\"5\"/\n   ```\n\n   To view the relevant parameters, refer to the **serverConf.xml** file.\n\n1.
