Open your delivery and click the **[!UICONTROL Audit]** tab of your delivery: you can see that the offer engine has selected the propositions to be made from the various offers in the catalog.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_delivery_example_010.png)\n\n## Perform an offer simulation {#perform-an-offer-simulation}\n\n1. In the **[!UICONTROL Profiles and Targets]** tab, click the **[!UICONTROL Simulations]** link, then click the **[!UICONTROL Create]** button.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_simulation_001.png)\n\n1.

Choose the offer space to be used for the simulation.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_simulation_example_006.png)\n\n1. Enter validity dates. You must at least enter a start date. This lets the offer engine filter offers and choose those which are valid on a given date. \n1. If necessary, specify one or several themes to restrict the number of offers to those which contain this keyword in their settings.\n\n   In our example, the **Travel** category contains two sub-categories with two separate themes. We want to run a simulation for offers with the **Customers>1 year** theme.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_simulation_example_007.png)\n\n1. Choose the recipients you want to target.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_simulation_example_008.png)\n\n1.

Save your settings, then click **[!UICONTROL Start]** in the **[!UICONTROL Dashboard]** tab to run the simulation.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_simulation_example_010.png)\n\n1. Once the simulation is finished, consult the **[!UICONTROL Results]** for a detailed breakdown of propositions per offer.\n\n   In our example, the offer engine has based the offer breakdown on 3 propositions. \n\n   ![](assets/offer_simulation_example_011.png)\n\n1. Display the **[!UICONTROL Breakdown of offers by rank]** to view the list of offers selected by the offer engine.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_simulation_example_012.png)\n\n1. If necessary, you can change the scope settings and run the simulation again by clicking **[!UICONTROL Start simulation]**.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_simulation_example_010.png)\n\n1. To save the simulation data, use the history or export functions available in the report. \n\n   ![](assets/offer_simulation_example_013.png)\n","headers":[["title","Offers on an outbound channel"],["description","Offers on an outbound channel"],["feature","Interaction, Offers"],["topic-tags","case-study"]],"sections":[{"section":"Offers on an outbound channel","sectionId":"ece07d2f-2ec5-48ae-832c-08aff87a11ed","paragraphs":[]},{"section":"Email offer delivery","sectionId":"e529f7c8-3993-405a-83c1-da2d732875f3","paragraphs":["In our database, there is a category of travel offers to Africa.
