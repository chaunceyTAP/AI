Each variant is then sent to population samples in order to determine which one performs better depending on the criteria of your choice (opens, spam complaints, clicks on a specific link, ...). \n\nIn the example below, the delivery target has been splitted into two groups, each representing 50% of the targeted population. Each group receives two versions of the delivery with two different promotional offers. After the delivery is sent, it is concluded that variant A performed better, based on the number of clicks on the promotional offers.\n\n![](assets/a-b-testing-schema.png)\n\nWith Campaign Classic, A/B testing is implemented through workflows, where you specify the population to target as well as the groups that will receive each variant (see [Configuring a/b testing](configuring-a-b-testing.md)).\n\nThe main steps are:\n\n1. **Target** the desired population.\n1. **Split the population** into sub-sets on which you will test the variants of your delivery.\n\n     For example, you can send one version of a delivery to a small portion of the targeted population, and another version to the remaining population. This allows you to test a new version of a delivery as opposed to the delivery that is usually sent to your customers. You can also divide the targeted population into 3 groups in order to send them  three different versions of a delivery.\n\n1. **Create multiple versions** of the delivery corresponding to each sub-set. The variant to test can be the subject, the message content, the sender name, etc.\n1. Start the workflow, then use the **delivery logs** to analyze the behavior of the sub-sets with each variant.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>Workflows also allow you to automate your processes by automatically identifying the delivery variant that performed better, then sending it to the remaining population.
