(NEO-27590)\n* The Google+ link has been removed from the **Social network sharing links** personalization block.\n* Fixed an issue after the implementation of a bug fix in the last release. A check was added on the hostname when connecting using SSL/TLS which led SMS deliveries to fail. Hostname verification has been disabled for most protocols such as POP3, SMS and HTTP with proxy and the certificate check for the SMS external account has been improved with three values (NEO-29581).

(NEO-27597)\n* Fixed an issue that could occur when upgrading to a build including the new signature mechanism for tracking links (from Build 19.1.4 and Campaign 20.2): when several templates were associated to an event, upgrading could cause the wrong template to be selected when sending the transactional message.

Please add this index.\n```\n\n* Fixed an issue which occurred when creating and saving a delivery within the **Targeting & Workflow** tab of a campaign: the preview would fail with the following error (NEO-29440):\n\n```\nXTK-170024 The temporary 'temp:deliveryEmail-all' schema is not defined in the current context\n```\n\n* Fixed an error which occurred when setting up an external account between a marketing instance and an Adobe Campaign Standard instance or a Campaign Classic mid-sourcing instance and using the option \"DisableFOH2=1\". When using the \"DisableFOH2=1\" option in the external account, connections were not properly closed and would pile up resulting in the following error (NEO-26258): \n\n```\nThe maximum number of connections has been reached (50) by connections pool 'nms:extAccount:acsDefaultRelayAccount XXX'. The server is overloaded. Please try again later.\n```\n\n* Fixed an error with SMS when connection issues occurred between the server and provider.
