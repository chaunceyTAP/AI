[Event collection](#event-collection)\n1. [Event transfer to a message template](#routing-towards-a-template)\n1. Event enrichment with personalization data\n1. [Delivery execution](../../message-center/using/delivery-execution.md)\n1. [Recycling of events](#event-recycling) whose linked delivery failed (via an Adobe Campaign workflow)\n\nOnce all the steps above are carried out through the execution instance, each targeted recipient receives a personalized message.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>For more on the transactional messaging instances, see [Transactional messaging architecture](../../message-center/using/transactional-messaging-architecture.md).\n\n\n## Event collection {#event-collection}\n\nEvents generated by the information system can be collected using two modes:\n\n* Calls to SOAP methods let you push events in Adobe Campaign: the PushEvent method lets you send one event at a time, the PushEvents method lets you send several events at once. For more on this, see [Event description](../../message-center/using/event-description.md).\n\n* Creating a workflow lets you recover events by importing files or via an SQL gateway (with the [Federated Data Access](../../installation/using/about-fda.md) option).\n\nOnce they are collected, events are broken down by technical workflows between real time and batch queues of the execution instance(s), while waiting to be linked to a message template.\n\n![](assets/messagecenter_events_queues_001.png)\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>On the execution instances, the **[!UICONTROL Real time events]** or **[!UICONTROL Batch events]** folders must not be set as views, as this could lead to access right issues. For more on setting a folder as a view, refer to [this section](../../platform/using/access-management-folders.md).\n\n## Routing towards a template {#routing-towards-a-template}\n\nOnce the message template is published on the execution instance(s), two templates are automatically generated: one to be linked to a real time event, and one to be linked to a batch event.\n\nThe routing step consists in linking an event to the appropriate message template, based on:\n\n* The event type specified in the properties of the event itself:\n\n    ![](assets/messagecenter_event_type_001.png)\n\n* The event type specified in the message template properties:\n\n    ![](assets/messagecenter_event_type_002.png)\n\nBy default, routing relies on the following information:\n\n* The event type\n* The channel to be used (by default: email)\n* The most recent delivery template, based on the publication date\n\n## Event statuses {#event-statuses}\n\nThe **Event history**, under **[!UICONTROL Message Center]** > **[!UICONTROL Event history]** , groups all the processed events into one single view. They can be categorized by event type or by **status**. These statuses are:\n\n* **Pending**: The event can be:\n\n    * An event which has just been collected and which has not yet been processed. The **[!UICONTROL Number of errors]** column shows the value 0. The email template has not yet been linked.\n    * An event processed but whose confirmation is erroneous. The **[!UICONTROL Number of errors]** column shows a value that is not 0. To know when this event will be processed again, consult the **[!UICONTROL Process requested on]** column.\n\n* **Pending delivery**: The event was processed and the delivery template is linked. The email is pending delivery and the classic delivery process is applied. For more information, you can open the delivery.\n* **Sent**, **Ignored** and **Delivery error**: These delivery statuses are recovered via the **updateEventsStatus** workflow. For more information, you can open the relevant delivery.\n* **Event not covered**: The transactional messaging routing phase failed. For example, Adobe Campaign did not find the email which acts as a template for the event.\n* **Event expired**: The maximum number of send tries was reached. The event is considered null.\n\n## Event recycling {#event-recycling}\n\nIf the delivery of a message on a specific channel fails, Adobe Campaign can resend the message using a different channel. For instance, if a delivery on the SMS channel fails, the message is resent using the email channel.\n\nTo do this, you need to configure a workflow which recreates all events with the **Delivery error** status, and assigns a different channel to them.\n\n>[!CAUTION]\n>\n>This step can only be carried out using a workflow and is therefore reserved for expert users.
