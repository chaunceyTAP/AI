If the hypothesis is based on an offer proposition, the latter needs to at least be presented and still be active. Offer and delivery hypotheses are created via the **[!UICONTROL Measurement hypotheses]** folder and are based on a hypothesis template. However, it is possible to reference a hypothesis directly in the delivery or the campaign before the campaign starts. In this case, the hypotheses will be calculated automatically once the marketing campaign is launched, based on execution settings. [Learn more](hypothesis-templates.md#hypothesis-template-execution-settings)\n\n## Create a hypothesis on the fly on a delivery {#creating-a-hypothesis-on-the-fly-on-a-delivery}\n\nTo create a hypothesis on an existing delivery, apply the following process:\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>This operation is only possible for pending deliveries.\n\n1. In the Adobe Campaign tree, go to **[!UICONTROL Campaign management > Measurement hypotheses]**.\n1. Click the **[!UICONTROL New]** button or right-click on the list of hypotheses and select **[!UICONTROL New]** in the drop-down list.\n\n   ![](assets/response_hypothesis_instance_creation_002.png)\n\n1. In the hypothesis window, select a previously created template. [Learn more](hypothesis-templates.md)\n\n   ![](assets/response_hypothesis_instance_creation_003.png)\n\n   The hypothesis context as it was defined in the selected model is displayed in the window.\n\n   >[!NOTE]\n   >\n   >Settings defined in the template and not visible at this step are also kept in the memory and reassigned to the hypothesis in progress.\n\n   ![](assets/response_hypothesis_instance_creation_004.png)\n\n1. Select the delivery for which you want to create a hypothesis.\n\n   ![](assets/response_hypothesis_instance_creation_005.png)\n\n1. You can personalize your hypothesis by editing the **[!UICONTROL General]**, **[!UICONTROL Transactions]** and **[!UICONTROL Scope]** tabs. [Learn more](hypothesis-templates.md#creating-a-hypothesis-model)\n1. Start the hypothesis by clicking **[!UICONTROL Start]**.\n\n   A workflow is automatically created to perform the measurement. The name is automatically defined depending on the hypothesis configuration.\n\n   >[!CAUTION]\n   >\n   >You can access this if you have checked the **[!UICONTROL Keep execution workflow]** box.  \n   >This option must be activated for debugging purposes only, in case of error while running the hypothesis.

If necessary, change the settings and re-start the hypothesis.\n\n## Reference a hypothesis in a campaign delivery {#referencing-a-hypothesis-in-a-campaign-delivery}\n\nYou can reference a hypothesis in a marketing campaign before it is started. In this case, the hypothesis will be launched automatically once the delivery is sent, based on the execution settings defined in the hypothesis template. To create a hypothesis in a delivery, apply the following process:\n\n1. Depending on your needs, you can create one or more **[!UICONTROL Delivery]** type templates, as described in [this section](hypothesis-templates.md#creating-a-hypothesis-model)\n1. Create a marketing campaign and targeting workflows.\n1. In the delivery window, click the **[!UICONTROL Delivery measurement]** icon.\n1. Select the hypothesis template (the query configured in the model is displayed in the hypothesis window).\n\n   The hypothesis will be calculated automatically once the campaign is finished, based on the dates configured in the model. [Learn more](hypothesis-templates.md#hypothesis-template-execution-settings)\n\n   ![](assets/response_hypothesis_instance_creation_008.png)\n\n## Add a default hypothesis to deliveries for a campaign {#adding-a-default-hypothesis-to-deliveries-for-a-campaign}\n\nYou can directly reference a hypothesis at campaign level. In this case, the hypothesis will be automatically linked to all the deliveries created in the campaign. To do this:\n\n1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Edit]** tab of the campaign.\n1. In the measurement section, click the **[!UICONTROL Default hypotheses]** tab.\n\n   ![](assets/response_hypothesis_instance_creation_010.png)\n\n1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add]** and select a hypothesis template.\n\n   ![](assets/response_hypothesis_instance_creation_011.png)\n\n   A hypothesis based on this template will now be referenced by default in each new delivery for the campaign.\n\n   ![](assets/response_hypothesis_instance_creation_012.png)\n\nThe hypothesis results can be viewed in the **[!UICONTROL General]** and **[!UICONTROL Reactions]** tabs of the hypothesis. [Learn more](hypothesis-tracking.md)\n\nFor more information, you can also refer to [this sample](#example--creating-a-hypothesis-linked-to-a-delivery).\n\n## Create a hypothesis on an offer {#creating-a-hypothesis-on-an-offer}\n\nCreating a hypothesis on an offer proposition is similar to creating an on the fly delivery hypothesis. The hypothesis can be executed as long as the offer is active. The calculation period is based on the offer proposition date. When the hypothesis lets you link a recipient to a purchase, the status of the offer proposition likely to be accepted can be changed automatically. [Learn more](hypothesis-templates.md#transactions)\n\n1. Create one or more **[!UICONTROL Offer]** type models as described in [this section](hypothesis-templates.md#creating-a-hypothesis-model).\n1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Campaign management > Measurement hypotheses]** node.\n1. Create an **[!UICONTROL Offers]** type hypothesis by selecting the model created previously.\n\n   ![](assets/response_hypothesis_instance_offer_001.png)\n\n   The query created in the model appears in the window.\n\n   ![](assets/response_hypothesis_instance_offer_003.png)\n\n1. Choose the offer for which you want to create a hypothesis.\n\n   ![](assets/response_hypothesis_instance_offer_004.png)\n\n1. Refine the query if necessary.\n1. Click **[!UICONTROL Start]** to run the hypothesis.\n1. The hypothesis results can be viewed in its **[!UICONTROL General]** and **[!UICONTROL Reactions]** tabs. [Learn more](hypothesis-tracking.md)\n\n   Hypotheses made on an offer are referenced in the **[!UICONTROL Measurement]** tab.\n\n   ![](assets/response_hypothesis_instance_offer_007.png)\n\n   If the **[!UICONTROL Update offer proposition status]** option was enabled in the hypothesis template, the status of the offer proposition is changed automatically, thereby providing feedback on the impact of the campaign (for more on this, refer to [Transactions](hypothesis-templates.md#transactions)).\n\n## Example: create a hypothesis linked to a delivery {#example--creating-a-hypothesis-linked-to-a-delivery}\n\nIn this example, we want to create a hypothesis linked to a delivery. This hypothesis will be based on the model created previously. [Learn more](hypothesis-templates.md#example--creating-a-hypothesis-template-on-a-delivery)\n\nWe will then refine the query inherited from the model to make a hypothesis on a specific article of the purchase table.\n\n1. Create a campaign and a delivery. [Learn more](../../campaign/using/setting-up-marketing-campaigns.md#creating-a-campaign)\n\n   In our example, we will use a direct mail type delivery.\n\n1. Configure a seed address: the previously created hypothesis template was configured to take a control group into account in the reaction results.\n\n   ![](assets/response_hypothesis_delivery_example_007.png)\n\n   >[!NOTE]\n   >\n   >For more information, refer to [this section](../../campaign/using/marketing-campaign-deliveries.md#defining-a-control-group).\n\n1. Open the **[!UICONTROL Direct mail delivery]** and click the **[!UICONTROL Delivery measurement]** icon, then click **[!UICONTROL Add]**.\n\n   ![](assets/response_hypothesis_delivery_example_002.png)\n\n1. Choose the previously created hypothesis template from the drop-down list.\n\n   ![](assets/response_hypothesis_delivery_example_004.png)\n\n   The query created in the model is displayed.\n\n   ![](assets/response_hypothesis_delivery_example_005.png)\n\n1. Click **[!UICONTROL Edit query...]** and refine the query by entering the product that the hypothesis will concern.\n\n   ![](assets/response_hypothesis_delivery_example_006.png)\n\n   You can check that the hypothesis is linked to the delivery in the **[!UICONTROL Edit]** > **[!UICONTROL Measurement]** tab of the campaign.\n\n   ![](assets/response_hypothesis_delivery_example_008.png)\n\n1. Launch your targeting workflow and run the necessary checks until the campaign is finished.
