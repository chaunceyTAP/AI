This mode is active in most cases except with some kernels for which Xen support has been disabled.\n\n  To check this, you can use the **uname -a | grep xen** command for example.\n\n  If the command does not return an empty line, it means configuration is correct.\n\n* You must have OpenSSL version **1.0.2** or higher.\n\n  For RHEL distributions, version 1.0 of OpenSSL is required.\n\n* To use Adobe Campaign, you need to have the **libicu** library installed.\n\n### SELinux {#selinux}\n\nWhen used, the SELinux module must be properly configured.\n\nTo do this, log on as root and enter the following command:\n\n```\necho 0 >/selinux/enforce\n```\n\nIn addition to this, in the **/etc/sysconfig/httpd** file, the following line was added to reference the Adobe Campaign environment configuration script:\n\n```\n. ~neolane/nl6/env.sh\n```\n\nIn RHEL and CentOS, compatibility issues with the client layers of databases were noted when SELinux is enabled. To be sure Adobe Campaign is able to operate correctly, we recommend disabling SELinux.\n\n**Apply the following process:**\n\n* Edit the file **/etc/selinux/config**\n\n* Modify the SELINUX line as follows:\n\n```\nSELINUX=disabled\n```\n\n### Fonts for MTA statistics {#fonts-for-mta-statistics}\n\nIn order for reports on MTA statistics (nms/fra/jsp/stat.jsp) to be displayed correctly, add fonts.\n\nIn Debian, add the command:\n\n```\napt install xfonts-base xfonts-75dpi ttf-bitstream-vera ttf-dejavu\n```\n\nUse the following command for RHEL:\n\n```\ndnf install xorg-x11-fonts-misc xorg-x11-fonts-75dpi dejavu-lgc-sans-fonts  dejavu-sans-fonts dejavu-sans-mono-fonts dejavu-serif-fonts\n```\n\n### Fonts for Japanese instances {#fonts-for-japanese-instances}\n\nFonts of specific characters are necessary for the Japanese instances in order to export the reports to PDF format.\n\nIn Debian, add the command:\n\n```\napt install fonts-ipafont\n```\n\nFor RHEL, add the following command:\n\n   ```\n   dnf install epel-release # if required\n   dnf install vlgothic-fonts\n   ```\n\n### Installing LibreOffice for Debian {#installing-libreoffice-for-debian}\n\nFor Debian, the following configurations are required:\n\n1. Install the following standard packages:\n\n   ```\n   apt-get install libreoffice-writer libreoffice-calc libreoffice-java-common\n   ```\n\n1. Install the following fonts (optional but highly recommended for Japanese instances):\n\n   ```\n   apt-get install fonts-ipafont\n   ```\n\n### Installing LibreOffice for CentOS {#installing-libreoffice-for-centos}\n\nThe following configurations are necessary with CentOS:\n\n   ```\n   yum install libreoffice-headless libreoffice-writer libreoffice-calc\n   ```\n\n## Database access layers {#database-access-layers}\n\nThe access layers for the database engine you are using must be installed on your server and be accessible via the Adobe Campaign account. Versions and installation modes may vary depending on the database engine used.\n\nThe supported pilot version are detailed in the [Compatibility matrix](../../rn/using/compatibility-matrix.md).\n\nAlso check the general [Database](../../installation/using/database.md) section.\n\n### PostgreSQL {#postgresql}\n\nAdobe Campaign supports all versions of the PostgreSQL client libraries from version 9.6: **libpq.so.5**.\n\nUsing PostgreSQL with Adobe Campaign also requires installing the corresponding **pgcrypto** libraries.\n\n### Oracle {#oracle}\n\nRetrieve the library version for 64-bit Debian, i.e.: **libclntsh.so**, **libclntsh.so.19.1**, **libclntsh.so.18.1**, **libclntsh.so.12.1**, **libclntsh.so.11.1** or **libclntsh.so.10.1**.\n\nYou can obtain a Linux RPM package from the Oracle Technology Network.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>If you have already installed the Oracle client but the global environment (for instance: /etc/profile) isn't properly configured, you can add missing information to the **nl6/customer.sh** script For more on this, refer to [Environment variables](../../installation/using/installing-packages-with-linux.md#environment-variables).\n\n**Troubleshooting and best practices**\n\nProblems can appear after an Oracle client or a server update, change of version or at the first installation of the instance.\n\nIf you notice on the client console that there are unexpected time lags (one or more hours) in logs, workflow last processing, next processing, and so on, there might be a problem between the library of the Oracle client and the Oracle Server. To avoid such problems\n\n1. Make sure to use the **full client**.\n\n   Various problems have been identified when using the Oracle Instant Client version. In addition, it is impossible to change the Timezone file on instant client.\n\n1. Make sure that the **client version** and the **database server version** are the **same**.\n\n   Mixing versions despite Oracle's compatibility matrix and recommendation to align client and server versions is known to cause problems.\n\n   Also check ORACLE_HOME value to make sure it points to the expected client version (in case several versions are installed on the machine).\n\n1. Make sure the client and the server use the same **timezone file**.\n\n## Implementation steps {#implementation-steps}\n\nAdobe Campaign installations for Linux must be carried out in the following sequence: server installation followed by instance configuration.\n\nThe installation process is described in this chapter. The installation steps are as follows:\n\n* Step 1: Installing the application server, refer to [Installing packages with Linux](../../installation/using/installing-packages-with-linux.md).\n* Step 2: Integrating with a Web server (optional, depending on the components deployed).\n\nOnce the installation steps are complete, you need to configure the instances, the database and the server. For more on this, refer to [About initial configuration](../../installation/using/about-initial-configuration.md).\n","headers":[["title","Prerequisites of Campaign installation in Linux"],["description","Prerequisites of Campaign installation in Linux"],["feature","Installation, Instance Settings"],["topic-tags","installing-campaign-in-linux-"]],"sections":[{"section":"Prerequisites to install Campaign on Linux","sectionId":"b7ad6083-c768-4055-a4fd-b9dd44f0cf6f","paragraphs":[]},{"section":"Software prerequisites","sectionId":"cbb90f16-11dc-403e-ae18-89161da609cb","paragraphs":["This section details the preliminary configurations steps required before installing Adobe Campaign.","The technical and software configuration required for installing Adobe Campaign is detailed in the Compatibility matrix.","As a reminder, the following components need to be installed and correctly configured:","Apache, refer to Compatibility matrix,\nJava JDK and OpenJDK, refer to Java Development Kit - JDK,\nLibraries, refer to Libraries,\nDatabase access layers, refer to Database access layers,\nLibreOffice, refer to Installing LibreOffice for Debian and Installing LibreOffice for CentOS,\nFonts, refer to Fonts for MTA statistics and Fonts for Japanese instances."]},{"section":"Libraries","sectionId":"82a057c8-17df-496d-aa7f-2413ebfa9b64","paragraphs":["To install Adobe Campaign in Linux, please make sure you have the required libraries.","Library C must be able to support TLS (Thread Local Storage) mode.
