Create a **.sh** file and name it **[!UICONTROL cust_indicators.sh]** .\n1. Add your customized indicators to this file. For example:\n\n   ```\n   #!/bin/bash \n   echo \"<indicator name='Zombie Processes'>  \n   <current label='Current Value' value='0' display=''/>  \n   <warning value='2'/>  <alert value='2'/>  \n   <max label='Max Value' value='2'/>\n   </indicator>\"\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```\n   #!/bin/bash \n   echo \"<indicator name='Availability'>  \n   <current label='Last update of data' display='2012-09-03 10:00'/>  \n   <current label='Availability last month' display='100.00%'/>  \n   <current label='Availability this month' display='100.00%'/> \n   <current label='Recent downtime periods' display='2012-07-04 11:10:00 - 11:19:59'/>\n   </indicator>\"\n   ```\n\n1. Save the file in the **[!UICONTROL usr/local/neolane/nl6]** folder.\n\nThis file is called by Adobe Campaign.\n\n## SMTP Reports {#smtp-reports}\n\nSMTP delivery monitoring reports are integrated into the Adobe Campaign platform. They can be accessed via the console or using Web access.\n\nThese reports display SMTP delivery statistics and SMTP errors by domain. To access them, the operator must have **Administration** rights.\n\nThey are grouped under **Monitoring** > 'SMTP Monitoring'.\n\n![](assets/smtp_reports_access.png)\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n>\n>* Information related to SMTP Monitoring is only available if the email channel has been activated.\n>* The **[!UICONTROL SMTP sending statistics]** are only offered if the statistics server is started on the instance. \n>\n\n### SMTP sending statistics {#smtp-sending-statistics}\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL SMTP sending statistics]** report lets you control server activity. It displays a synthesis of each of the mtachilds.\n\n![](assets/smtp_stats_report.png)\n\nThe list of indicators for this report is shown below the chart.\n\n1. Total number of messages sent.\n1. Represents in/out messages:\n  \n   * Blue line: messages ready for sending which arrived in the Shaper, i.e. last stage before sending SMTP (coincides with the incoming data).\n\n   * Green line: messages successfully sent (coincides with the outgoing data).\n\n   * Red line: messages abandoned by the Shaper, returned to the **mta** (coincides with the data rejected on this recovery).\n\n   These values are expressed in number of messages per hour. \n\n1. Represents two queues of the Shaper:\n\n   * Blue curve: queue of active messages. These messages will be sent as soon as possible.\n\n   * Kaki curve: the 'deferred' queue. These messages cannot be returned for the moment due to throttling or because no connection to the target is available. Retries will take place every 5s, 10s, 20s, 40s, 2 min, etc. for the defined **MaxAgeSec** time before being abandoned. \n\n1. This charts shows a detail of abandoned messages (red curve on the 2nd chart): it shows the proportion of messages abandoned without retries (mauve) compared with messages whose sending failed (red). This lets you view the proportion of messages not processed within the granted period due to limitations by the statistics server (throttling) or due to remote server unavailability. \n1. SMTP connections open or being opened.\n1. Estimate of the number of **mtachild**.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>This report is related to the status of the Email Traffic Shaper component.\n\n### SMTP errors per domain {#smtp-errors-per-domain}\n\nThis report lets you view the delivery errors, over a set period, broken down by domain.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>The **minConnectionsToLog**, **minErrorsToLog** and **minMessagesToLog** options of the **serverConf.xml** file define the thresholds above which connection statistics are taken into account.\n\n![](assets/smtp_error_report.png)\n\nThe list of indicators for this report is shown below the table.\n\n* The **Domain** column contains the name of the domain to which the messages are sent (or the real domain name, yahoo.com for yahoo.fr for example),\n* The **Cnx** column displays the number of SMTP connections open for this domain,\n* The **Sent** column corresponds to the number of messages sent to this domain,\n* The **Volume** column displays the volume of messages that have been attempted to be sent to this domain (approximate value),\n* The **Errors** column displays a volume indicator of errors on this domain over the period,\n* The **Last response** column displays the last SMTP response message received for this domain,\n* The **Date** column displays the date of the last SMTP response received for this domain.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>The values displayed in the **Cnx**, **Sent**, and **Volume** columns are calculated with respect to the period selected in the **[!UICONTROL Period]** field.\n\nClick on a domain name to view its errors.\n\nThey are categorized by PublicId: this identifier corresponds to an IP address shared by several Adobe Campaign mtas behind a router. The statistics server uses this identifier to memorize the connection and delivery statistics between this starting point and the target server.\n\n![](assets/smtp_error_report_details.png)\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL Owner of domain]** field lets you group various domain names under the same label. In the initial report view, all MX domain names will be associated to this owner.\n\nClick on a PublicId identifier to view further detail.\n\n![](assets/smtp_error_report_subdetails.png)\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>The percentage of errors is represented by two charts. The first is a horizontal progress bar on a black background. The second chart is chronological. The selected period is divided into twelve time intervals, each represented by a vertical progress bar. In both representations, if no error has been detected, the bar is black. The color of the bar depends on the percentage of errors encountered (yellow, then orange, and lastly, red). The color grey means that no significant data volume has been found. It is possible to display the exact percentage of errors by putting the cursor on the chart.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>For further information about SMTP errors and managing them in Adobe Campaign, please consult [this section](../../installation/using/email-deliverability.md).\n\n## Billing report {#billing-report}\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL Billing]** technical workflow sends the system activity report to the 'billing' operator by email. It is triggered by default the 25th of every month on the Marketing instance.\n\nThe technical workflow can be found in a sub-folder of the following node: **Administration** > **Production** > **Technical workflows**.\n\n![](assets/billing.png)\n\nOnce the workflow is started every 25th of the month, your billing operator will receive the following report in their inbox.\n\n![](assets/billing_2.png)\n\nThe following metrics are available to track your deliveries:\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Start date]** : Start date of the delivery. Note that it can be earlier than the report's \"from\" date.\n* **[!UICONTROL Label]** : Label of the delivery. Deliveries that have less than 100 messages to send are considered too small and thus aggregated by start date, in which case the label displays the number of aggregates, e.g. [Aggregation of 3 small deliveries].\n* **[!UICONTROL Total volume]** : Total volume of bytes transferred for the delivery.\n* **[!UICONTROL Avg volume]** : Average volume of bytes transferred. This is the result of the following formula **(total volume / messages)**, which is the calculation basis of the **[!UICONTROL Multiplier]** metric.\n* **[!UICONTROL Messages]** : Number of sent messages. This includes both messages that were successfully sent and retries (following the reception of a bounce message from the contacted server).\n* **[!UICONTROL Multiplier (x)]** : The value of the multiplier is deduced from the messages' average volume.\n* **[!UICONTROL Count]** : Result of the multiplication of the messages and the multiplier.\n\n## Automatic monitoring {#automatic-monitoring}\n\nAdobe Campaign offers several automatic monitoring methods, which are presented below.\n\n### Command line {#command-line}\n\nCommand\n\n**nlserver monitor**\n\nLets you list a set of indicators on the Adobe Campaign modules and the system.\n\nIt generates output in an easily processed XML format.\n\nThis command can also be run with the **-missing** parameter, which lists the processes that are missing from this instance when the configuration files say that they should be executing.\n\n```sql\nnlserver monitor -missing\nHH:MM:SS > Application server for Adobe Campaign Classic (7.X YY.R build XXX@SHA1) of DD/MM/YYYY\nmta@prod\nstat@prod\nwfserver@prod\n```\n\n### Information published by the server {#information-published-by-the-server}\n\n#### /r/test {#r-test}\n\nThe **http(s)://`<application>`/r/test** page is used to test the redirection server. We recommend using this same method to test the frontal servers used for tracking. This page can also be used to test a load dispatcher.\n\nIt displays a line like this in XML format:\n\n```\n<redir status='OK' date='YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.112Z' build='XXXX' host='<hostname>' localHost='<servername>'/>\n\n```\n\n**Frequency**: this test does not use any load, and so it can be run very often (e.g. once every second).\n\n#### /nl/jsp/ping.jsp {#nl-jsp-ping-jsp}\n\nThis **http(s)://`<Application server url>`/nl/jsp/ping.jsp**  page operates in the same way as its network counterpart: it tests a complete query going through apache/tomcat/web module/database and uploading to the client. If everything is working properly, it returns an \"OK\". We recommend running this test on machines with access to the databases (mtas and surveys, for instance).\n\n**Usage**: a session token associated with an operator login must be passed as an argument in order to log in remotely (see the tip in [Automatic monitoring via Adobe Campaign scripts](#automatic-monitoring-via-adobe-campaign-scripts)).\n\nFor example: \n\n![](assets/ncs_monitoring_ping.png)\n\nThe operator name and login need to be previously configured in the Adobe Campaign client console with database rights.\n\n![](assets/ncs_operators_rights_01.png)\n\n**Frequency**: this is a test that uses very little bandwidth. It can therefore be run fairly often, though not more than once a minute.\n\n#### /nl/jsp/monitor.jsp {#nl-jsp-monitor-jsp}\n\nThis is a test to check that an operator can access the Adobe Campaign server via a web page; the same web page as the one accessed via the client console menus. You can call this page from your surveillance tools (Tivoli, Nagios, etc.).\n\n![](assets/ncs_monitoring_web.png)\n\n**Usage**: a session token associated with an operator login which lets you connect to the instance needs to be used as an argument (see the tip in [Automatic monitoring via Adobe Campaign scripts](#automatic-monitoring-via-adobe-campaign-scripts)).\n\nThe operator and their login needs to be configured previously in the Adobe Campaign client console with the appropriate database rights and restrictions.\n\n**Frequency**: this is a full server test and doesn't need be run often (it can be carried out once every ten minutes, for example).\n\n#### /nl/jsp/soaprouter.jsp {#nl-jsp-soaprouter-jsp}\n\nThis **jsp** represents the point of entry of Adobe Campaign application APIs. It can therefore provide detailed monitoring of the application. It can also be used to monitor Adobe Campaign web services. It is used in our monitoring scripts, but note that it is for power users only.\n\n### Monitoring based on deployment types {#monitoring-based-on-deployment-types}\n\nAdobe Campaign enables various deployment configurations (for more on this, refer to [this section](../../installation/using/hosting-models.md)). This section details the various automatic monitoring techniques to be applied depending on your type of installation.\n\n<table> \n <thead> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Deployment type </th> \n   <th> Monitoring </th> \n  </tr> \n </thead> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td> Stand-alone </td> \n   <td> \n    <ul> \n     <li><p> <span class=\"uicontrol\">/r/test</span> and <span class=\"uicontrol\">/nl/jsp/monitor.jsp</span> on the Adobe Campaign server</p> </li> \n    </ul> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> Standard </td> \n   <td> \n    <ul> \n     <li><p> <span class=\"uicontrol\">/r/test</span> and <span class=\"uicontrol\">/nl/jsp/ping.jsp</span> on the frontal servers</p> </li> \n     <li><p> <span class=\"uicontrol\">/nl/jsp/monitor.jsp</span> on the application server</p> </li> \n    </ul> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> Enterprise </td> \n   <td> \n    <ul> \n     <li><p> <span class=\"uicontrol\">/r/test</span> and <span class=\"uicontrol\">/nl/jsp/ping.jsp</span> on the frontal servers</p> </li> \n     <li><p> <span class=\"uicontrol\">/r/test</span> and <span class=\"uicontrol\">/nl/jsp/monitor.jsp</span> on the application server</p> </li> \n    </ul> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td> Mid-sourcing </td> \n   <td> \n    <ul> \n     <li><p> <span class=\"uicontrol\">/nl/jsp/monitor.jsp</span> on the application server</p> </li> \n    </ul> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table>\n\n## Automatic monitoring via Adobe Campaign scripts {#automatic-monitoring-via-adobe-campaign-scripts}\n\nAdobe Campaign can provide an instance monitoring tool (netreport) that lets you send a report by email regarding the detected anomalies. \n\n![](assets/pro_netreport.png)\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n>\n>This tool can be used to monitor your instances but is not supported by Adobe Campaign. Contact your Campaign Administrator for more information.\n\n### Required elements {#required-elements}\n\nThe following pre-installation precautions are required for automatic monitoring:\n\n* You must have the **netreport.tgz** (Linux installation) or **netreport.zip** (Windows installation) files,\n* We strongly advise you not to install monitoring on the machine to be monitored, \n* it must be installed on a machine with a JRE or a JDK,\n* in Linux, the machine to be monitored must have the **bc** package. For more on this, refer to [this section](../../installation/using/installing-packages-with-linux.md#distribution-based-on-rpm--packages).\n\n### Installation procedure {#installation-procedure}\n\nThe installation procedure is as follows:\n\n1. In the console, create a new operator if necessary (the 'monitoring' user already exists), but do not assign any rights. \n1. Run archive extraction.\n1. Read the **readme** file.\n1. Update the **netconf.xml** configuration file.\n1. Update the **netreport.bat** (Windows) or **netreport.sh** (Linux) file.\n\n### Configuring the netconf.xml file {#configuring-the-netconf-xml-file}\n\nThe XML configuration file contains the following elements:\n\n* ['Properties' element](#properties--element)\n* ['Instance' element](#instance--element)\n* ['Host' element](#host--element)\n* [Sub-elements](#sub-elements)\n\nHere is a configuration example:\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n<netconf>\n  <properties mailServer=\"mail.adobe.net\" mailFrom=\"mail@adobe.com\" recipientList=\"recipient@adobe.com\">\n    <nightMode start=\"00:00 am\" end=\"07:00 am\"/>\n    <buildRange minimum=\"7829\" maximum=\"8180\"/>\n    <buildRange minimum=\"8300\" maximum=\"8400\"/>\n    <sla/>\n  </properties>\n\n  <instance name=\"dev\" recipientList=\"mail@mail.com,mail2@mail.com\">\n                <host name=\"devrd.domain.com\" alias=\"devrd\" sessiontoken=\"monitoring\" criticalLevel=\"1\" filter=\"wkf;new\">\n                                <ncs instance=\"devrd\" url=\"/nl/jsp/soaprouter.jsp\" includeDead=\"false\" isSecure=\"false\"/>\n                                <redir url=\"/r/test\"/>\n                                <http url=\"/nl/jsp/ping.jsp\"/>\n                </host>\n                <host name=\"devtrk.domain.com\" alias=\"devtrk\" sessiontoken=\"monitoring\" criticalLevel=\"0\" filter=\"wkf;new\">\n                                <ncs instance=\"devrd\" url=\"/nl/jsp/soaprouter.jsp\" includeDead=\"true\" isSecure=\"false\"/>\n                </host>\n  </instance>\n  <host name=\"dev-test\" alias=\"dev-test\" sessiontoken=\"monitoring\" criticalLevel=\"2\">\n                <ncs instance=\"dev\" url=\"/nl/jsp/soaprouter.jsp\" includeDead=\"false\"/>\n  </host>\n</netconf>\n\n```\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>You can specify various configurations by adding a suffix to the **netconf.xml** file, for example, **netconf-dev.xml**, **netconf-prod.xml**, etc. Then specify the configuration to use for executing the netreport in the **netreport.bat** or **netreport.sh** files by adding **$JAVA_HOME/bin/java netreport dev** or **@%JAVA_HOME%binjava netreport prod** for example.\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n>\n>For the **monitoring** operator to work, the machine that the netreport is executed on must be in a security zone that is in **sessionTokenOnly** mode. If no trusted IP mask has been specified for this operator, the security zone must also be in **allowEmptyPassword** and **allowUserPassword** mode.\n\n#### 'Properties' element {#properties--element}\n\nThis element is used to populate the configuration of emails, i.e.\n\n* **mailServer**: SMTP server used to send emails (e.g.: smtp.domain.net).\n* **mailFrom**: email address of the report sender (e.g.: monitoring@domain.net). \n* **recipientList**: the list of email addresses of monitoring recipients. Addresses must be separated by commas (no spaces).\n* '**night**' mode (optional) is used to avoid sending emails between the specified times period. Instead, the data is consolidated, and an email concerning the night's activity is sent after the end time (7:00 by default).\n* The **buildRange** sub-element (optional) lets you specify a minimum and maximum build number. An error will be generated for all machines whose build number does not fall into this range\n\n  ```\n  <buildRange minimum=\"0000\" maximum=\"9999\"/>\n  ```\n\n* You can add an **`<sla>`** (optional) sub-element in the **properties** element. A log file will be generated every time the netreport is executed. The name of the file contains the configuration name and the date and time, for example **dev_06_12_13_16_47_05.tmp**.
