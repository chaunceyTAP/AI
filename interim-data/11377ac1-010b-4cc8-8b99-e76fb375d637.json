Adobe Campaign provides a set of graphical representations. Their configuration is detailed below.\n\nCharts are inserted directly into a report page via the right-click menu or the toolbar.\n\n## Creation steps {#creation-steps}\n\nTo create a chart in a report, apply the following steps:\n\n1. Edit the page where you want to display the chart and select the chart type on the toolbar.\n\n   ![](assets/s_advuser_report_page_activity_04.png)\n\n1. Enter a name and caption. If necessary, you can change the position of the caption using the drop-down list.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_wizard_018.png)\n\n1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Data]** tab to define the data source and the series to be calculated.\n\n   The statistics to be displayed in the chart can be calculated based on a query or on the context data, i.e. the data provided by the inbound transition of the current page (for more on this, refer to [Using context data](../../reporting/using/using-the-context.md#using-context-data)).\n\n    * Click the **[!UICONTROL Filter data...]** link to define filtering criteria for the data in the database.\n    \n      ![](assets/reporting_graph_add_filter.png)\n\n    * To used contextual data, select **[!UICONTROL Context data]** from the **[!UICONTROL Source]** drop-down and click the **[!UICONTROL Advanced settings...]** link. Then select the data which the statistics will concern.\n    \n      ![](assets/reporting_graph_from_context.png)\n\n      You will then be able to access the contextual data to define the values to be displayed in the chart:\n    \n      ![](assets/reporting_graph_select-from_context.png)\n\n## Chart types and variants {#chart-types-and-variants}\n\nAdobe Campaign offers various types of graphical representations. They are detailed below.\n\nThe chart type is selected when it is inserted into the page. \n\n![](assets/s_advuser_report_page_activity_04.png)\n\nIt can also be altered via the **[!UICONTROL Chart type]** section of the **[!UICONTROL General]** tab in the chart.\n\n![](assets/reporting_change_graph_type.png)\n\nVariants depend on the selected chart type. They are selected via the **[!UICONTROL Variants...]** link.\n\n### Breakdown: pie charts {#breakdown--pie-charts}\n\nThis type of graphical representation lets you display an overview of the measured elements.\n\nPie charts only enable you to analyze one variable.\n\n![](assets/reporting_graph_type_sector_1.png)\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL Variants]** link lets you personalize the overall rendering of the chart.\n\n![](assets/reporting_graph_type_sector_2.png)\n\nPie charts let you enter the value of the inner radius in the appropriate field.\n\nFor example:\n\n0.00 traces a full circle.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_sector_exple1.png)\n\n0.40 traces a circle with a radius of 40%.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_sector_exple2.png)\n\n1.00 only traces the outside of the circle.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_sector_exple3.png)\n\n### Evolution: curves and areas {#evolution--curves-and-areas}\n\nThis type of graphical representation lets you understand the evolution of one or more measures in time. \n\n![](assets/reporting_graph_type_curve.png)\n\n### Comparison: histograms {#comparison--histograms}\n\nHistograms enable you to compare the values of one or more variables.\n\nFor these types of charts, the following options are offered in the **[!UICONTROL Variants]** window:\n\n![](assets/reporting_select_graph_var.png)\n\nCheck the **[!UICONTROL Display caption]** option to show the caption with the chart and choose its position:\n\n![](assets/reporting_select_graph_legend.png)\n\nWhen appropriate, you can stack values together.\n\n![](assets/reporting_graph_type_histo.png)\n\nIf necessary, you can reverse the value display sequence. To do this, select the **[!UICONTROL Reverse stacking]** option.\n\n### Conversion: funnel {#conversion--funnel}\n\nThis type of chart lets you track the conversation rate of measured elements.\n\n## Interaction with the chart {#interaction-with-the-chart}\n\nYou can define an action when the user clicks the chart. Open the **[!UICONTROL Interaction events]** window and select the action you want to perform.\n\nPossible interaction types and their configurations are detailed in [this section](../../web/using/static-elements-in-a-web-form.md#inserting-html-content).\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_wizard_017.png)\n\n## Compute statistics {#calculating-statistics}\n\nCharts let you display statistics on the collected data.\n\nThese statistics are defined via the **[!UICONTROL Series parameters]** section of the **[!UICONTROL Data]** tab.\n\nTo create a new statistic, click the **[!UICONTROL Add]** icon and configure the appropriate window. The available calculation types are detailed below.\n\n![](assets/reporting_add_statistics.png)\n\nFor more on this, refer to [this section](../../reporting/using/using-the-descriptive-analysis-wizard.md#statistics-calculation).\n","headers":[["title","Create a chart"],["description","Learn how to design a chart"],["feature","Reporting, Monitoring"]],"sections":[{"section":"Create a chart","sectionId":"8e85f3da-27d8-4d02-a3f6-2d4e4e861aae","paragraphs":["The data in the database can also be collected and displayed in a chart.
