Refer to [Creating a delivery via content management](#creating-a-delivery-via-content-management)\n\nThey can also be used to create content instances. Once they have been created, these instances are ready to be delivered (refer to [Delivering a content instance](#delivering-a-content-instance)) or exported (refer to [Creating a content instance](#creating-a-content-instance)).\n\n## Creating a delivery via content management {#creating-a-delivery-via-content-management}\n\nYou can reference a content template in a delivery in view of using input fields to enter content. An additional tab is added to the delivery wizard for defining delivery content. \n\n![](assets/s_ncs_content_deliver_a_content.png)\n\nThe layout will be applied automatically based on the selected settings. To view it, click the **[!UICONTROL HTML preview]** (or **[!UICONTROL Text preview]** ) and select a recipient to test personalization elements.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_content_deliver_a_content_html.png)\n\nFor more on this, refer to the full implementation example: [Creating content in the delivery wizard](use-case-creating-content-management.md#creating-content-in-the-delivery-wizard).\n\n## Creating a content instance {#creating-a-content-instance}\n\nYou can create contents directly in the Adobe Campaign tree to be used in workflows, exported, or injected straight into new deliveries.\n\nApply the following steps:\n\n1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Resources > Contents]** node of the tree, right-click and choose **[!UICONTROL Properties]**.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_content_folder_properties.png)\n\n1. Select the publication templates that will be active for this folder. \n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_content_folder_templates.png)\n\n1. You can now create new content using the **[!UICONTROL New]** button above the content list.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_content_folder_create_a_template.png)\n\n1. Enter the fields in the form.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_content_folder_use_a_template.png)\n\n1. Then click the **[!UICONTROL HTML preview]** tab to view the rendering. Here, the personalization fields taken from the database aren't entered.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_content_folder_use_a_template_preview.png)\n\n1.

Click the **[!UICONTROL Properties]** link to change its label, status, or view its history.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_content_folder_template_properties.png)\n\n1.

You can change the publication folder thanks to the **NcmPublishingDir** option.\n\n## Delivering a content instance {#delivering-a-content-instance}\n\nTo create a content instance and deliver it, a delivery template needs to be linked to the publication template used to generate this content. For more on this, refer to [Delivery](publication-templates.md#delivery).\n\nMoreover, the content storage folder must be dedicated to contents taken from this publication template (when a content folder enables you to generate several types of content, deliveries can't be created automatically).\n\nTo create the delivery automatically based on the selected content, click the **[!UICONTROL Delivery]** icon and choose the template.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_content_folder_create_the_delivery.png)\n\nText and HTML contents are entered automatically.\n","headers":[["title","Use a content template"],["description","Use a content template"],["feature","Templates"]],"sections":[{"section":"Use a content template","sectionId":"9f5cc2d3-d847-41e0-9a9f-1560a3edd9ab","paragraphs":[]},{"section":"About content templates","sectionId":"19bd9f5c-8875-437d-96bf-80cc09c14c55","paragraphs":["Content templates can be referenced and used in deliveries directly.
