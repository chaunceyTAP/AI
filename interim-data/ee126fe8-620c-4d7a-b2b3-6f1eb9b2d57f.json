Some mailboxes can be more impacted than others, as some companies have specific security tools which can impact links and alter the URL signature mechanism.\n\nAs a consequence, Adobe recommends that you disable the signature mechanism for tracking links. This procedure fixes old tracking links except the ones received with a double escaping.\n\nNote that unsubscription links can fail as any other links, the frequency is variable from host to host but is less than 1%.\n\n**Are you impacted?**\n\nTo improve security, the signature mechanism for tracking links in emails has been introduced in [Campaign Gold Standard 8](../../rn/using/gold-standard.md#gs8) - April 2020 - and is enabled by default for all customers starting Build 19.1.4 (9032@3a9dc9c) and Campaign 20.2.\n\nIf your environment is running on one of the versions listed below, you can be impacted:\n\n* Gold Standard 8 to 11. [Learn more](../../rn/using/gold-standard.md#gs-8)\n* Campaign 21.1.1 (build 9277) to 21.1.2 (build 9282) releases.

In the [server configuration file](../../installation/using/the-server-configuration-file.md) (serverConf.xml), change **signEmailLinks** to **false**.\n1. Restart the **nlserver** service.\n1.
