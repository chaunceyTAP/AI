No additional action is required.\n\n* As an **on-premise/hybrid** customer, you need to enable Microsoft Edge Chromium on your instance(s). \n    \n    When upgrading to Campaign Classic v7.3 (and later), a new `webView2Mode` attribute is available in the Campaign server configuration file `serverConf.xml`. This attribute must be enabled.\n\n    To perform this, apply the following steps on all your environments (MKT, MID, RT):\n\n    1. Edit the Campaign server configuration file (`serverConf.xml`)\n    1. In the `<web>` module, set `webView2Mode = \"1\"`\n    1. Run the following command to reload the server configuration:\n\n        ```\n        nlserver config -reload\n        ```\n\n    1. Run the following command to restart the web server:\n\n        ```\n        nlserver restart web\n        ```\n\n    1. If your environment uses Apache as a web server, run the following command to restart Apache:\n\n        ```\n        /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n        ```\n\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>For any questions about these changes, contact [Adobe Customer Care](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html/enterprise/using/support-for-experience-cloud.ug.html).\n>\n\n## Related topics\n\n* [Upgrade your environment](../../production/using/build-upgrade.md)\n* [Build upgrade FAQ](../../platform/using/faq-build-upgrade.md)\n* [Install Campaign Client Console](../../installation/using/installing-the-client-console.md)\n","headers":[["title","Technote - Enabling Microsoft Edge Chromium on your Campaign environment"],["description","Campaign - Edge Chromium"],["feature","Technote, Upgrade"]],"sections":[{"section":"How to enable Microsoft Edge Chromium on your environment","sectionId":"e8efdf36-2e49-49bd-b454-01f55b5f0db1","paragraphs":[]},{"section":"What changed?","sectionId":"9341925a-d567-4734-98fa-808d12edf263","paragraphs":["Following the end of life of Microsoft Internet Explorer 11, the HTML rendering engine for dashboards in the client console is using Edge Chromium, starting Campaign Classic v7.3.","In addition to the installation of Microsoft Edge Webview 2 runtime, which is now required for any client console installation, Microsoft Edge Chromium must be enabled on your instance(s).","NOTE","After enabling Microsoft Edge Chromium, the Ctrl+F (Windows) or Command+F (Mac) shortcut to open the browser's search dialog box will no longer work."]},{"section":"Are you impacted?","sectionId":"56aea15e-5c6a-493e-b7a5-771e3875b642","paragraphs":["If your environment has been upgraded to Campaign Classic v7.3 (or later), you are impacted."]},{"section":"How to update?","sectionId":"0db6f790-0354-4116-b179-71b6a753a3ad","paragraphs":["As a hosted customer, Adobe already enabled Microsoft Edge Chromium on your instance(s).
