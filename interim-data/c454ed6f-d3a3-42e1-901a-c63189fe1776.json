Follow the steps below to configure access to Sybase IQ.\n\n1. Configure [Sybase IQ database](#configuring-sybase) \n1. Configure the Sybase IQ [external account](#sybase-external) in Campaign\n\n## Sybase IQ configuration {#configuring-sybase}\n\nConnecting to a Sybase IQ external database in FDA requires additional configurations below on the Adobe Campaign server.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>Before starting, make sure the **unixodbc** package is on the server.\n\n1. Install **iq_odbc**. An error can occur at the end of the installation. This error can be ignored.\n\n1. Install **iq_client_common**. A Java error can occur at the end of the installation. This error can be ignored.\n\n1. Configure the ODBC driver. The configuration can be carried out in the standard files: /etc/odbc.ini for general parameters and /etc/odbcinst.ini for declaring drivers:\n\n    * **/etc/odbc.ini** (replace values like `<server_alias>` characters by your own):\n\n      ```\n      [ODBC Data Sources]\n      <server_alias>=libdbodbc.so\n\n      [<server_alias>]\n      Driver=/opt/sybase/IQ-16_0/lib64/libdbodbc16.so\n      Description=<description>\n      Username=<username>\n      Password=<password>\n      ServerName=<server_name>\n      CommLinks=tcpip(host=<host>)\n      ```\n\n    * **/etc/odbcinst.ini**\n\n      ```\n\n      [ODBC DRIVERS]\n      SAP SybaseIQ=Installed\n      \n      [SAP SybaseIQ]\n      Driver=/opt/sybase/IQ-16_0/lib64/libdbodbc16.so\n      ```\n\n1. Add the path for the new libodbc16.so library in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable. To do that:\n\n    * If you are using a customer.sh file to declare your path: add the path /opt/sybase/IQ-16_0/lib64 for the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.\n    * Otherwise, use a Unix command.\n\n## Sybase IQ external account {#sybase-external}\n\nThe Sybase IQ external account allows you to connect your Campaign instance to your Sybase IQ external database.\n\n1. From Campaign **[!UICONTROL Explorer]**, click **[!UICONTROL Administration]** '>' **[!UICONTROL Platform]** '>' **[!UICONTROL External accounts]**.\n\n1. Click **[!UICONTROL New]** and select **[!UICONTROL External database]** as **[!UICONTROL Type]**.\n\n1. To configure the **[!UICONTROL Sybase IQ]** external account, you must specify:\n\n     * **[!UICONTROL Type]**: ODBC (Sybase ASE, Sybase IQ)\n\n    * **[!UICONTROL Server]**: Corresponds to the ODBC connection (`<server_alias>`) defined in step 5. Not necessarily the name of the server itself.\n\n    * **[!UICONTROL Account]**: Name of the user\n\n    * **[!UICONTROL Password]**: User account password\n\n    * **[!UICONTROL Database]**: Name of the database\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>For Windows, you must install the Sybase IQ client on the Adobe Campaign server and create an ODBC connection.
