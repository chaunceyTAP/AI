Access to a report depends on its selection type, display conditions and access authorizations.\n\n### Selection type {#selection-type}\n\nAccess to the report can be limited to a specific context or offer space, for instance a delivery, a recipient, a selection of recipients, etc. This access is configured in the **[!UICONTROL Selection type]** section of the **[!UICONTROL Display]** tab.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_visibility_4.png)\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Single selection]** : the report is only accessible when a specific entity is selected. \n* **[!UICONTROL Multiple selection]** : the report is accessed when several entities are selected.\n* **[!UICONTROL Global]** : the report is accessed via the list of available reports in the **[!UICONTROL Reports]** tab.\n\n### Display sequence {#display-sequence}\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL Sequence]** field lets you enter a numeric value that specifies the display sequence of the report in the list.\n\nBy default, reports are displayed by relevance: the value entered in this field lets you sort reports from the most (highest value) to the least (smallest value) relevant.\n\nYou can select the scale to be used based on your needs: 1 to 10, 0 to 100, -10 to 10, etc.\n\n### Display conditions {#display-conditions}\n\nYou can also condition the display of the report via a query. \n\n![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_visibility_5.png)\n\nIn the following example, the report is displayed if the main campaign channel is email.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_visibility_6.png)\n\nThis means that if the main channel of the campaign is direct mail, the report won't be available in the campaign reports.\n\n### Access authorization {#access-authorization}\n\nThe report can be shared with other operators.\n\nTo make the report accessible, select the **[!UICONTROL Report shared with other operators]** option. If this option isn't selected, only the operator who created the report can access the report.\n\nThe report can also be shared with specific operators or groups of operators added via the authorizations window.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_visibility_8.png)\n\n### Define the filtering options {#defining-the-filtering-options}\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL Reports]** tab displays all available reports in the platform and for which the connected operator has an access right.\n\nBy default, they are sorted by relevance, but you can apply other types of filters: alphabetical, by age, etc.\n\nYou can also filter the display based on the report category:\n\n![](assets/report_ovv_select_type.png)\n\nTo define the category of a report, select it via the **[!UICONTROL Display]** tab, as shown below:\n\n![](assets/report_select_category.png)\n\nYou can enter a new category here, and add it to the list of available categories. The matching enumeration is updated automatically.\n\n## Create a link to a report {#creating-a-link-to-a-report-}\n\nIt's possible to make a report accessible via a specific node of the tree, such as a list, a recipient, a delivery, etc. To do this, simply create a link to the concerned report and specify the entity where you want to make it available.\n\nAs an example, we are going to create a link to a report to make it accessible via a list of recipients.\n\n1. Click **[!UICONTROL New]** and select **[!UICONTROL Create a link to an existing report]** in the report creation wizard.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_wizard_link_01.png)\n\n1. Select the report you want to create a link to using the drop-down list. In this example, we're going to select the **Breakdown by country** report.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_wizard_link_02.png)\n\n1. Enter a label and select the schema. In this example, we're going to select the recipient lists table. \n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_wizard_link_03.png)\n\n   This means that the report will be accessible via any recipients list and that statistics will concern the recipients in the selected list.\n\n1. Saving and displaying your report.\n1. Enter the link key. In this case, the foreign key of the 'Folders' link.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_wizard_link_04.png)\n\n1. Publish your report.\n1. Go to one of your recipient lists and click the **[!UICONTROL Reports]** link: the report you have just created is accessible.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_wizard_link_05.png)\n\n## Preview of the report {#preview-of-the-report}\n\nBefore publishing your report, make sure it is displayed correctly in the **[!UICONTROL Preview]** tab.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_preview_01.png)\n\nTo display the preview of the report, select the **[!UICONTROL Global]** or the **[!UICONTROL Selection]** option.\n\nThese two options are selected based on the display settings of the report. If the display setting is **[!UICONTROL Global]**, you need to select the **[!UICONTROL Global]** preview option. If the display settings are **[!UICONTROL Single selection]** or **[!UICONTROL Multiple selection]**, the **[!UICONTROL Selection]** preview option must be selected.\n\nFor more on this, refer to [Report display context](#report-display-context).\n\nSpecific settings enable you to control errors. The **_uuid** setting is found in the URL of the report. You can add the **&_preview** or the **&_debug** settings to it.\n\nTo learn more about these settings, refer to the **Defning web form properties** section of the [Web forms](../../web/using/about-web-forms.md) chapter.\n\n## Publish the report {#publishing-the-report}\n\nPublishing the report is mandatory in order to share them with other operators and display them in the list of available reports (also refer to [Report display context](#report-display-context)). This operation must be carried out again each time the report is changed.\n\n1. Open the publishing wizard by clicking **[!UICONTROL Publish]** in the toolbar.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_publish_01.png)\n\n1.
