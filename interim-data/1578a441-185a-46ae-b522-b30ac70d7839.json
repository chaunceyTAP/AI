Some configurations can only be performed by on-premise customers.\n\n## Privacy\n\n<img src=\"assets/do-not-localize/icon_privacy.svg\" width=\"60px\">\n\nPrivacy configuration and hardening is a key element of security optimization. Here are some best practices to follow regarding privacy:\n\n* Protect your customer PII by using HTTPS instead of HTTP\n* Use PII view restriction to protect privacy and prevent data from being misused.\n* Make sure that encrypted passwords are restricted.\n* Protect the pages that might contain personal information such as mirror pages, web applications, etc.\n\n[Read more](../../installation/using/privacy.md)\n\n## Access management\n\n<img src=\"assets/do-not-localize/icon_access.svg\" width=\"60px\">\n\nAccess management is an important part of security hardening. Here are some of the main best practices:\n\n* Create enough security groups\n* Check that each operator has the appropriate access rights\n* Avoid using the admin operator and avoid having too many operators in the admin group\n\n[Read more](../../installation/using/access-management.md)\n\n## Scripting and coding guidelines\n\n<img src=\"assets/do-not-localize/icon_scripting.svg\" width=\"60px\">\n\nWhen developing in Adobe Campaign (workflows, Javascript, JSSP, etc.), always follow these guidelines:\n\n* **Scripting**: try to avoid SQL statements, use parameterized functions instead of string concatenation, avoid SQL injection by adding the SQL functions to use to the allowlist.\n\n* **Secure the data model**: use named rights to limit operator actions, add system filters (sysFilter)\n\n* **Add captchas in web applications**: learn how to add captchas in your public landing pages and subscription pages.\n\n[Read more](../../installation/using/scripting-coding-guidelines.md)\n\n## Network, database and SSL/TLS\n\n<img src=\"assets/do-not-localize/icon_network.svg\" width=\"60px\">\n\nA very important thing to check when deploying an on-premise type of architecture is the networking configuration. \n\nIt is also imperative that you follow your database engine security.\n\n[Read more](../../installation/using/network-database.md)\n\n\n## Server configuration\n\n<img src=\"assets/do-not-localize/icon_server.svg\" width=\"60px\">\n\nConfiguration has to be performed on all servers. The configuration files are of the type **serverConf.xml** and **`config-<instance>.xml`**. Here are the key elements that need to be verified:\n\n* **Security zones**: Configure security zones so that they directly take into account the IP addresses of clients of a proxy.\n\n* **File upload protection**: limit the types of files that can be uploaded to the Adobe Campaign server using a new uploadAllowList attribute. This can be used in the server configuration file.\n\n* **Relay**: fine tune the relay configuration by deactivating the relay rules for unused modules/applications.\n\n* **Outgoing connection protection** and **Command restriction** (server-side)\n\n* You can also add extra HTTP headers, activate checkIPConsistent, enableTLS, sessionTimeOutSec, etc. Refer to the [Campaign server configuration documentation](../../installation/using/configuring-campaign-server.md) and the [Server configuration file description](../../installation/using/the-server-configuration-file.md) for more information.\n\n[Read more](../../installation/using/server-configuration.md)\n\n## Web-server configuration\n\n<img src=\"assets/do-not-localize/icon_web.svg\" width=\"60px\">\n\nSeveral best practices should be followed when configuring your web-server (Apache/IIS):\n\n* Disable old SSL version and ciphers\n* Remove the TRACE method\n* Remove the banner\n* Limit query size to prevent important files from being uploaded\n\n[Read more](../../installation/using/web-server-configuration.md)\n","headers":[["title","Security and privacy checklist"],["description","Learn more about the key elements to check regarding security and privacy"],["feature","Installation, Privacy, Access Management, Privacy Tools"],["topic-tags","prerequisites-and-recommendations-"]],"sections":[{"section":"Security and privacy checklist","sectionId":"dcf1eb83-c1f5-4fc1-8bb1-94acaa2566a8","paragraphs":["This section will introduce you to the key elements to check regarding security and privacy.
