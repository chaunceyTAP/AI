Two transactional message templates are also available for transactional messaging.\n\n![](assets/nmac_intro_3.png)\n\n\nYou can define the application behavior for when the user activates the notification to display the screen that matches the application context. For example:\n\n* A notification is sent to the customer to let them know their parcel has exited the warehouse. Activating the notification opens a page with delivery-related information on it.\n* The user has added items to the cart, but left the application without completing the purchase. A notification is sent, telling them that their cart has been abandoned. When they activate the notification, the item is displayed on the screen.\n\n>[!CAUTION]\n>\n>* You need to make sure the notifications sent to a mobile application are compliant with the prerequisites and conditions specified by Apple (Apple Push Notification Service) and Google (Firebase Cloud Messaging).\n>* Warning: in some countries, the law requires that you inform users of your collected data type mobile applications and the purpose of their processing. You must check the legislation.\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL NMAC opt-out management]** (mobileAppOptOutMgt) workflow updates notification unsubscriptions on mobile devices. For more information on this workflow, refer to the [list of technical workflows](../../workflow/using/about-technical-workflows.md).\n\nAdobe Campaign is compatible with HTTP/2 APNs.

Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK provides client-side integration APIs for your mobiles via Android and iOS compatible SDKs. SDKs configuration is managed through the Data Collection UI for flexible configuration and extensible, rules-based integrations. Learn more in [Adobe Campaign v8 documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/send/push/push-settings).\n\n\n## Data path {#data-path}\n\nThe following schemas detail the steps that enable a mobile application to exchange data with Adobe Campaign. This process involves three entities:\n\n* the mobile application\n* the notification service: APNs (Apple Push Notification Service) for Apple and FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) for Android\n* Adobe Campaign\n\nThe three main steps of the notification process are: registration of the application in Adobe Campaign (subscription collection), deliveries, and tracking.\n\n### Step 1: Subscription collection {#step-1--subscription-collection}\n\nThe mobile application is downloaded by the user from the App Store or from Google Play. This application contains the connection settings (iOS certificate and project key for Android) and the integration key. The first time the application is opened, (depending on configuration), the user can be asked to enter registration information (@userKey: email or account number for instance). At the same time, the application questions the notification service to collect a notification ID (push ID). All this information (connection settings, integration key, notification identifier, userKey) is sent to Adobe Campaign.\n\n![](assets/nmac_register_view.png)\n\n### Step 2: Delivery {#step-2--delivery}\n\nMarketers target application subscribers. The delivery process sends the connection settings to the notification service (iOS certificate and project key for Android), the notification ID (push ID) and the content of the notification. The notification service sends notifications to the targeted terminals.\n\nThe following information is available in Adobe Campaign:\n\n* Android only: number of devices that have displayed the notification (impressions)\n* Android and iOS: number of clicks on the notification\n\n![](assets/nmac_delivery_view.png)\n\nThe Adobe Campaign server must be able to contact the APNs server on the 443 port for iOS HTTP/2 connector.\n\nTo check that it works correctly, use the following commands:\n\n* For tests:\n\n  ```\n  api.development.push.apple.com:443\n  ```\n\n* In production:\n\n  ```\n  api.push.apple.com:443\n  ```\n\nWith the iOS HTTP/2 connector, the MTA and web server must be able to contact the APNs on port 443.\n\nIf you need to use the iOS HTTP/2 connector through a proxy, refer to this [page](../../installation/using/file-res-management.md#proxy-connection-configuration).\n","headers":[["title","Get started with mobile app channel "],["description","Get started with mobile app channel in Adobe Campaign"],["feature","Push"]],"sections":[{"section":"Get started with mobile app channel","sectionId":"e89fffcd-7473-45cb-abd6-5304057bd8a5","paragraphs":["The Mobile App Channel lets you use the Adobe Campaign platform to send personalized push notifications to iOS and Android terminals via apps.","Two delivery channels are available:","An iOS channel that enables you to send notifications to Apple mobile devices.","An Android channel that enables you to send data messages to Android mobile devices.","IMPORTANT","Some important changes to the Android Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) service will be released in 2024, and may impact your Adobe Campaign implementation.
