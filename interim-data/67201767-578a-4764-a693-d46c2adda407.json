This content can then be delivered via a 'Delivery' activity.\n\n>[!CAUTION]\n>\n>Content management is an optional Adobe Campaign module. Please check your license agreement.\n\nThe properties of the activity are divided into three steps:\n\n* **Content selection**: the content can have been created previously or can be created via the activity.\n* **Content update**: the task can modify the subject of the content or import all of the XML content.\n* **Action**: the resulting content can be saved or generated.\n\n  ![](assets/content_mgmt_edit.png)\n\n  For more on configuring and using content management in Adobe Campaign, refer to this [section](../../delivery/using/about-content-management.md).\n\n1. **Content**\n\n    * **[!UICONTROL Specified in the transition]**\n\n      This option lets you use the content specified in the transition, i.e. the event that activates content management must contain a **[!UICONTROL contentId]** variable. This variable can have been set by a previous content management or by any script.\n    \n    * **[!UICONTROL Explicit]**\n\n      This option lets you select a content already created, via the **[!UICONTROL Content]** field. This field is visible only when the **[!UICONTROL Explicit]** option is selected.\n    \n      ![](assets/content_mgmt_explicit.png)\n\n    * **[!UICONTROL Calculated by a script]**\n\n      The content identifier is calculated by a script. The **[!UICONTROL Script]** field lets you define a JavaScript template evaluating the identifier (primary key) of the content. This field is visible only when the **[!UICONTROL Calculated by a script]** option is selected.\n    \n      ![](assets/content_mgmt_script.png)\n\n    * **[!UICONTROL New, created from a publication template]**\n\n      Creates a new content from a publication template. This new content will be saved in the file specified in the **[!UICONTROL String]** field.

When this option is selected, the **[!UICONTROL URL]** field specifies the XML content downloading URL. The **[!UICONTROL XSL stylesheet]** lets you specify the stylesheet to be used to transform the downloaded XML document.
