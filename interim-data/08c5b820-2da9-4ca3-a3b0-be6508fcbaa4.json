For **hosted** customers, please contact Adobe.\n\n**External Account**\n\nThere should only be **one** external account with the following settings:\n\n* **Internal Name**: Adobe_Marketing_Cloud\n* **Type**: Adobe Marketing Cloud\n\nDelete any duplicate external account that have same the same settings.\n\n**Product Context**\n\nIf the external account has a **Product Context** field, check that its value is set to: **dma_campaign_classic**\n\nMake sure your product context is the same for Campaign and Experience Cloud.\n\nFor example, if the **Product Context** does not appear, the default product context should be **dma_campaign** in both Campaign and Experience Cloud. If the **Product Context** field appears, the default product context should be **dma_campaign_classic** in both Campaign and Experience Cloud.\n\n**[!UICONTROL IMS Server URL]**\n\nIn the Campaign **Adobe Marketing Cloud** external account, check that the **[!UICONTROL IMS Server URL]** is either `adobeid-na1.services.adobe.com` or `ims-na1.adobelogin.com`. Make sure both stage and production instances point to the same IMS production end point.\n\n**Association Mask**\n\n* Check that the user trying to login is part of an operator group in the Enterprise Dashboard.\n* Check that the **[!UICONTROL Association Mask]** is a prefix of the user's operator group name in the Enterprise Dashboard.\n* Make sure there are no white spaces and spelling mistakes. \n* Check that the names of the operator groups in Campaign have not been changed and respect the following syntax:\n\n```\n<Association Mask> + <Operator Group Name in Campaign> = Complete name of the operator group in Enterprise Dashboard\n```\n\n**Scope**\n\nScopes defined in the Campaign external account must be a subset of those provisioned by IMS.\n\n**Callback URL**\n\nThe **Callback URL** should be added to the allowlist and start with \"https://\". Check that the **Callback URL** is linked to the corresponding instance. For example, the production instance should redirect to the production URL.\n\n**Client ID and secret**\n\nThe client ID matches between the Campaign external account and the one provisioned by IMS.\n\nCheck that the client secret entered is correct.\n\n**Restart the server**\n\nRestart the server if any changes are made to the above settings in the Campaign external account\n\n**Common types of errors and possible solutions**\n\n* User is redirected to adobe.com page:\n\n  There is a problem with the **[!UICONTROL Callback URL]**. Refer to the previous steps to check the **[!UICONTROL Callback URL]** configuration.\n\n* Message \"Login does not have any right matching the expression\":\n\n  Refer to the previous steps to check the **[!UICONTROL Association Mask]** and operator groups configuration.\n\n* The user is unable to access the Adobe ID login page:\n\n  Refer to the previous steps to check the scope configuration.\n","headers":[["title","IMS troubleshooting"],["description","IMS troubleshooting"],["feature","Configuration"],["topic-tags","connecting-via-an-adobe-id"]],"sections":[{"section":"IMS troubleshooting","sectionId":"d86a0923-0fa3-46d9-9661-cfedfb2dccfe","paragraphs":["The following troubleshooting tips will help on-premise and hybrid customers solve the most common problems happening when using the IMS integration.
