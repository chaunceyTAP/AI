Depending on its configuration, this web application can contain any type of defined personalized elements. For example, you can suggest links to evaluate the target, the budget, the content, etc. via dedicated APIs.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>APIs are detailed in a dedicated document.

To unload your winter stock and make room for your new stock, you decide to create a special offer that will target two client categories: the over 30s, to whom you will offer age sensitive skin care products, and the under 30s, to whom you will offer the more basic skin care products.\n\nYou therefore decide to use Distributed Marketing to create a collaborative campaign (by form) which will allow you to select clients from your different stores by the age ranges. These clients will receive an email delivery with a special offer that will have been personalized according to their age range.\n\nThe first part of this example illustrates your local entities receiving the campaign creation notification, and how they can use it to evaluate the campaign and order it.\n\nThe second part of this example explains how to create your campaign.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n\n**For the local entity**\n\n1. Use the campaign creation notification to access the online form.\n1. Personalize the campaign (target, content, delivery volume).\n1. Check these fields and change them if necessary.\n1. Approve your participation.\n1. The manager of the local entity (or the central entity) approves your configuration and participation.\n\n**For the central entity:**\n\n1. Create the collaborative campaign.\n1. Configure the **[!UICONTROL Advanced campaign settings...]** as you would for a local campaign.\n1. Configure the campaign workflow and the delivery as you would for a local campaign.\n1. Update the web form.\n1. Create the campaign package and publish it.\n\n### Local entity side {#local-entity-side-1}\n\n1. The local entities selected to take part in the campaign receive an email notification informing them of their participation in the campaign.\n\n   ![](assets/mkg_dist_use_case_form_7.png)\n\n1. The local entities complete the personalized form, then they:\n\n    * evaluate the target and the budget, \n    * preview the delivery content,\n    * approve their participation.\n    \n      ![](assets/mkg_dist_use_case_form_8.png)\n\n1. The operator in charge of validating orders approves their participation.\n\n   ![](assets/mkg_dist_use_case_form_9.png)\n\n### Central entity side {#central-entity-side-1}\n\n1. To implement a collaborative campaign (by form), you must create a campaign using the **Collaborative campaign (by form)** template.\n\n   ![](assets/mkg_dist_use_case_form_1.png)\n\n1. In the campaign's **[!UICONTROL Edit]** tab, click the **[!UICONTROL Advanced campaign settings...]** link to configure it as a local campaign. Refer to [Creating a local campaign (by form)](#creating-a-local-campaign--by-form-).\n\n   ![](assets/mkg_dist_use_case_form_2.png)\n\n1. Configure the campaign workflow and the web form. Refer to [Creating a local campaign (by form)](#creating-a-local-campaign--by-form-).\n1. Create your campaign package by specifying the execution schedule and the local entities involved.\n\n   ![](assets/mkg_dist_use_case_form_3.png)\n\n1. Finalize the package configuration by selecting the approval mode in the **[!UICONTROL Edit]** tab.\n\n   ![](assets/mkg_dist_use_case_form_4.png)\n\n1. From the **[!UICONTROL Description]** tab, you can enter a campaign package description, a notification message to be sent to local entities when the package is published, and attach any informative documents to your campaign package.\n\n   ![](assets/mkg_dist_use_case_form_5.png)\n\n1. Approve the package to publish it.\n\n   ![](assets/mkg_dist_use_case_form_6.png)\n","headers":[["title","Distributed Marketing samples"],["description","Distributed Marketing samples"],["feature","Distributed Marketing"]],"sections":[{"section":"Distributed Marketing samples","sectionId":"19a00bf2-078c-4093-8594-41df9087668a","paragraphs":[]},{"section":"Create a local campaign (by form)","sectionId":"38d8968e-d8e5-433e-8d8d-c9e14f49bd86","paragraphs":["The By form type web interface involves using a web application.
