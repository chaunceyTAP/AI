As Adobe Campaign Classic works with 3rd party tools, compatibility is updated on a regular basis, in order to implement supported versions only. Versions which are no longer compatible with Adobe Campaign Classic are listed below and in the [Compatibility matrix](../../rn/using/compatibility-matrix.md).\n\nTo communicate the impending removal/replacement of Campaign Classic capabilities, the following rules apply:\n\n* Announcement of deprecation comes first. While deprecated capabilities can still be available and supported for existing users, they will not be further enhanced, nor documented. \n* Removal of deprecated capabilities will occur in the following release at the earliest. Actual target date for removal is announced in this page. \n\nThis process gives customers at least one release cycle to adapt their implementation to a new version or successor of a deprecated capability, before actual removal. \n\n>[!NOTE]\n>Adobe Campaign releases and new capabilities are listed in the [Release Notes](../../rn/using/latest-release.md).\n\n## Deprecated features {#deprecated-features}\n\nThis section lists features and capabilities that have been marked as deprecated with latest Campaign Classic releases. \n\nGenerally, features that are planned to be removed in a future release are set to deprecated first. These features and capabilities are either no longer available for new Campaign Classic customers, or should not be used for any new implementation. They are also removed from product documentation.\n\nCustomers are advised to review if they make use of the feature/capability in their current deployment, and make plans to change their implementation. Please refer to the target removal date to plan your environment and project updates accordingly.\n\n<table> \n <tbody> \n   <tr>\n   <td><strong>Feature</strong></td>\n   <td><strong>Details</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n <td>Campaign (Neolane) legacy SDK</td>\n <td><p>The Campaign (Neolane) SDK for mobile applications is now deprecated.
