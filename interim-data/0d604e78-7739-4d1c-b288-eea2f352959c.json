Creating the list\n\n    * Click the **[!UICONTROL Lists]** link in the **[!UICONTROL Profiles and targets]** menu of the Adobe Campaign home page.\n    * Click the **[!UICONTROL Create]** and then the **[!UICONTROL Import a list]** button.\n\n1. Selecting the file to import\n\n   Click the folder to the right of the **[!UICONTROL Local file]** field and select the file containing the list to import.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_user_import_example00_01.png)\n\n1. List name and storage\n\n   Input the name of the list and select the directory where it should be saved.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_user_import_example00_02.png)\n\n1. Launching the import\n\n   Click **[!UICONTROL Next]** and then **[!UICONTROL Start]** to start importing the list.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_user_import_example00_03.png)\n\n## Import new records from a text file {#example--import-new-records-from-a-text-file-}\n\nTo import new recipient profiles stored in a text file into the Adobe Campaign database, apply the following steps:\n\n1. Choosing a template\n\n    * From the Adobe Campaign home page, click the **[!UICONTROL Profiles and targets]** link, then **[!UICONTROL Jobs]**. Above the list of jobs, click **[!UICONTROL New import]**.\n    * Keep the **[!UICONTROL New text import]** template selected by default.\n    * Change the label and the description.\n    * Select **[!UICONTROL Simple import]**.\n    * Keep the default job folder.\n    * Click **[!UICONTROL Advanced parameters]** and select the **[!UICONTROL Tracking mode]** option to view the details of your import during execution.\n\n1.

Associating fields\n\n   Click the **[!UICONTROL Guess the destination fields]** icon to map the source and destination schemas automatically. Check the information in this window before clicking **[!UICONTROL Next]**.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_user_import_example03_01.png)\n\n1. Reconciliation\n\n    * Go to the **Recipients (nms:recipient)** table.\n    * Select the **[!UICONTROL Insertion]** operation and leave the default values in the other fields.\n    \n      ![](assets/s_ncs_user_import_example04_01.png)\n\n1.

To do this, from the home page click **[!UICONTROL Profiles and Targets]** then **[!UICONTROL Processes]**, select the relevant import, and look up the **[!UICONTROL General]**, **[!UICONTROL Journal]** and **[!UICONTROL Rejects]** tabs.\n\n        * Checking import progress\n        \n          ![](assets/s_ncs_user_import_example07_01.png)\n\n        * Process viewing for each record\n        \n          ![](assets/s_ncs_user_import_example07_02.png)\n\n## Update and insert recipients {#example--update-and-insert-recipients}\n\nWe want to update existing records in the database and create new ones from a text file. Here is an example of the procedure:\n\n1. Choosing a template\n\n   Repeat the steps described in example 2 above.\n\n1. File to import\n\n   Select the file that you want to import.\n\n   In our example, the overview of the first lines of the file shows that the file contains updates for three records and the creation of a record.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_user_import_example02_02.png)\n\n1. Associating fields\n\n   Apply the procedure in example 2 above.\n\n1. Reconciliation\n\n    * Keep **[!UICONTROL Update or insert]** selected by default.\n    * Keep the option **[!UICONTROL Management of duplicates]** in **[!UICONTROL Update]** mode so that existing records in the database will be modified with data from the text file.\n    * Select the fields **[!UICONTROL Birth date]**, **[!UICONTROL Name]** and **[!UICONTROL Company]** and assign a reconciliation key to them. \n    \n      ![](assets/s_ncs_user_import_example04_02.png)\n\n1.

Other fields contain a different value from the one contained in the database.\n\n* Content of the text file to import.\n\n  ![](assets/s_ncs_user_import_example02_03.png)\n\n* Database status before import\n\n  ![](assets/s_ncs_user_import_example06_04.png)\n\nApply the following steps:\n\n1. Choosing a template\n\n   Apply the procedure in example 2 above.\n\n1. File to import\n\n   Select the file that you want to import.\n\n1. Associating fields\n\n   Apply the procedure in example 2 above.\n\n   In the preview of the first lines of the file, you can see that the file contains updates for certain records.\n\n1.

Launching the import\n\n   Click **[!UICONTROL Start]**.\n\n   Look in the recipient table to check that the records have been modified by the import.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_user_import_example06_05.png)\n\n   Only values that were empty have been replaced by values from the text file, but the existing value in the database has not been overwritten by the value from the import file.\n\n## Update and enrich the values from those in an external file {#example--update-and-enrich-the-values-from-those-in-an-external-file}\n\nWe want to modify certain fields in a database table from a text file, giving priority to the values contained in the text file.\n\nIn this example, you will see that certain fields in your text file have an empty value, while the corresponding fields in the database are not empty. Other fields contain a different value from the one in the database.\n\n* Content of the text file to import.\n\n  ![](assets/s_ncs_user_import_example02_04.png)\n\n* Database status before import\n\n  ![](assets/s_ncs_user_import_example06_07.png)\n\n1. Choosing a template\n\n   Apply the procedure in example 2 above.\n\n1. File to import\n\n   Select the file that you want to import.\n\n   In the preview of the first lines of the file, you can see that the file contains empty fields and updates for certain records.\n\n1. Associating fields\n\n   Apply the procedure in example 2 above.\n\n1. Reconciliation\n\n    * Go to the table and select **[!UICONTROL Update]**.\n    * Select the option **[!UICONTROL Reject entity]** for the **[!UICONTROL Management of doubles]** field.\n    * Leave the option **[!UICONTROL Management of duplicates]** in **[!UICONTROL Update]** mode for existing records in the database to be modified with data from the text file.\n    * Place the cursor on the **[!UICONTROL Account number (@account)]** node and select the option **[!UICONTROL Take empty values into account]**.\n    * Select the fields **[!UICONTROL Birth date]**, **[!UICONTROL Email]** and **[!UICONTROL First name]** and assign a reconciliation key to them. \n    \n      ![](assets/s_ncs_user_import_example04_04.png)\n\n1.
