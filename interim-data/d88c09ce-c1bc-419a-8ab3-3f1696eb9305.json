Go to the **[!UICONTROL Campaigns]** tab and click the **[!UICONTROL Web application]** link, then click the **[!UICONTROL Create]** button.\n1. Select the **[!UICONTROL New landing page]** template and enter a label, then click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.\n\n   ![](assets/dce_uc1_newlandingpage.png)\n\n1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Edit]** tab.\n1. Delete the **End** activity.\n1. Add a **[!UICONTROL Page]** activity after the **[!UICONTROL Storage]** activity.\n1. Edit the **Page 2** activity then uncheck the **[!UICONTROL Activate outbound transitions]** option in the **[!UICONTROL Properties]** tab.\n\n   ![](assets/dce_uc1_transition.png)\n\n1. Save changes.\n\nYou will then get the following sequencing:\n\n![](assets/dce_uc1_edition_activity.png)\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>For more on creating a Web application, refer to [this section](creating-a-new-web-application.md).\n\n## Step 1 - Selecting and loading templates {#step-1---selecting-and-loading-templates}\n\nIn this section, we are going to look at how to **import HTML content** for each page of the Web application.\n\nA template must contain:\n\n* an **HTML** file (mandatory)\n* one or more **CSS** files (optional)\n* one or more **images** (optional)\n\nTo load the template on the first page, apply the following steps:\n\n1. Open the first **[!UICONTROL Page]** activity of the Web application.\n1. Select **[!UICONTROL From a file]** to fetch your content template.\n\n   ![](assets/dce_uc1_selectmodel.png)\n\n1. Select the HTML file to use.\n1. Click **Open** to start the import.\n\n   During loading, the list of shared files is displayed. The import system checks that all files linked to the selected HTML are there (CSS, images, etc.).\n\n   Click the **[!UICONTROL Close]** button once the import has finished.\n\n   ![](assets/dce_uc1_import.png)\n\n   >[!CAUTION]\n   >\n   >You must wait until you get the following message before closing: **[!UICONTROL The external resources have been successfully published]** .\n\n1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Properties]** tab.\n1. Enter a **label** for each page (for example: Page 1= Collect, Page 2=Thank you).\n\n   ![](assets/dce_uc1_pagelabel.png)\n\nApply these steps for each page inserted in the Web application.\n\n>[!CAUTION]\n>\n>**The DCE executes the JavaScript code for the loaded HTML page.** JavaScript errors in the HTML template which may appear in the Adobe Campaign interface. These errors are not related to the editor. To check that there are no errors in the imported files, it is recommended you test them in a web browser before importing the files into the DCE.\n\n## Step 2 - Configuring the content {#step-2---configuring-the-content}\n\nIn this section, we are going to adjust imported content and link the fields of the database to the form of the web page. The Web application created previously is: \n\n![](assets/dce_uc1_lp_enchainement.png)\n\n### Modifying content {#modifying-content}\n\nLet's start by changing the colors of the page. To do this:\n\n1. Open the **[!UICONTROL Collection]** page.\n1. Click the background.\n1. Click **Background color** on the right-hand side.\n1. Select a new background color.\n1. Click **OK** to confirm the change.\n\n   ![](assets/dce_uc1_changecolor.png)\n\n1. Apply these same processes to change the color of the button\n\n   ![](assets/dce_uc1_finalcolor.png)\n\n### Linking form fields {#linking-form-fields}\n\nWe are going to link the fields in the page to those in the database, in order to save the information provided.\n\n1. Select a form field.\n1. Edit the **[!UICONTROL Field]** section on right-hand side of the editor.\n1. Select the database field that you want to link to the selected field.\n\n   ![](assets/dce_uc1_mapping.png)\n\n1. Repeat this process for each field on the page.\n\nYou can make a field mandatory: for example, click the **[!UICONTROL Email]** field then enable the **Mandatory** option.\n\n![](assets/dce_uc1_fieldmandatory.png)\n\n### Creating a link to the next page {#creating-a-link-to-the-next-page}\n\nThis step is mandatory because it will allow the Web application to determine the sequence of the next steps: Saving the collected data in the database then displaying the next page (**Thank you** page).\n\n1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Send it!]** button of the **[!UICONTROL Collection]** page.\n1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Action]** drop-down menu.\n1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Next page]** action.\n\n   ![](assets/dce_uc1_actionbouton.png)\n\n### Inserting a personalization field {#inserting-a-personalization-field}\n\nThis step lets you personalize the Thank you page. To do this:\n\n1. Open the **[!UICONTROL Thank you]** page.\n1. Place the cursor in a text area, where you wish to insert the recipient's first name.\n1. Select **[!UICONTROL Personalization field]** in the **[!UICONTROL Insert]** menu of the toolbar. \n1. Select the first name.\n\n   ![](assets/dce_uc1_persochamp.png)\n\nThe personalization field has a yellow background in the editor.\n\n![](assets/dce_uc1_edit_champperso.png)\n\n## Step 3 - Publishing content {#step-3---publishing-content}\n\nContent is published from the Web application dashboard. Click the **[!UICONTROL Publish]** button to run it.\n\n![](assets/dce_uc1_pub_dashboard.png)\n\nDuring publication, a log is displayed. The publishing system analyzes all the content found in the Web application \n\n![](assets/dce_uc1_pub_dashboard_journal.png)\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>In the publication log, warnings and errors are sorted by activity.\n\nThe form is now available: its URL is accessible in the application dashboard and can be sent to recipients.\n","headers":[["title","Create a landing page"],["description","Create a landing page"],["feature","Landing Pages"]],"sections":[{"section":"Create a landing page","sectionId":"41f5ef3d-4bc2-4483-bed2-70465a7e85ed","paragraphs":[]},{"section":"About landing pages creation","sectionId":"fcecdf49-e88f-4cef-ba91-8c3bbbc26770","paragraphs":["This use case shows the use of the Digital Editor to create a Landing Page from the Adobe Campaign console.","Before you start configuring the Landing Page in Adobe Campaign, make sure you have one or more templates to represent the HTML page(s).","The main aim of this use case is to make the Landing Page form fields correspond with the internal fields in Adobe Campaign using the functions in the DCE."]},{"section":"Creating the landing page","sectionId":"6de8e6d3-7d03-41cb-a475-69d3c6796567","paragraphs":["To create a new Landing Page type Web application, use the following steps:","Go to the Campaigns tab and click the Web application link, then click the Create button.","Select the New landing page template and enter a label, then click Save.","Click the Edit tab.","Delete the End activity.","Add a Page activity after the Storage activity.","Edit the Page 2 activity then uncheck the Activate outbound transitions option in the Properties tab.","Save changes.","You will then get the following sequencing:","NOTE","For more on creating a Web application, refer to this section."]},{"section":"Step 1 - Selecting and loading templates","sectionId":"8464f2cc-45c7-45cd-981f-71bd3ccf3dd2","paragraphs":["In this section, we are going to look at how to import HTML content for each page of the Web application.","A template must contain:","an HTML file (mandatory)\none or more CSS files (optional)\none or more images (optional)","To load the template on the first page, apply the following steps:","Open the first Page activity of the Web application.","Select From a file to fetch your content template.","Select the HTML file to use.","Click Open to start the import.","During loading, the list of shared files is displayed.
