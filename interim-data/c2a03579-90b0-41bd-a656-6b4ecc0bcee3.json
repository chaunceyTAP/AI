For more information, refer to [this section](../../production/using/backup.md).   \n>* To perform an upgrade, make sure you have the ability and permissions to access instances and logs.\n>* Read out [this section](../../installation/using/general-architecture.md) and the [build upgrade](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/acc-build-upgrade.html) chapter before starting.\n>\n\n## Windows {#in-windows}\n\nOn a Windows environment, follow the steps below to update Adobe Campaign to a new build:\n\n* [Shut down services](#shut-down-services),\n* [Upgrade the application server](#upgrade-the-adobe-campaign-server-application),\n* [Synchronize resources](#synchronize-resources),\n* [Restart services](#restart-services).\n\nTo find out how to update the client console, refer to [this section](../../installation/using/client-console-availability-for-windows.md).\n\n### Shut down services {#shut-down-services}\n\nIn order to replace all files with the new version, you need to shut down all instances of the nlserver service.\n\n1. Shut down the following services:\n\n    * Web services (IIS):\n\n      **iisreset /stop**\n    \n    * Adobe Campaign service: **net stop nlserver6**\n\n   >[!IMPORTANT]\n   >\n   >You also need to make sure the redirection server (webmdl) is stopped, so that the **nlsrvmod.dll** file used by IIS can be replaced with the new version.\n\n1. Check that no tasks are active by running the **nlserver pdump** command. The following should come up:\n\n   ```sql\n   C:<installation path>Adobe Campaign v7bin>nlserver pdump\n   HH:MM:SS > Application Server for Adobe Campaign Classic (7.X YY.R build XXX@SHA1) of DD/MM/YYYY\n   No tasks\n   ```\n\n   You can use the Windows Task Manager to make sure all processes are stopped.\n\n### Upgrade the Adobe Campaign server application {#upgrade-the-adobe-campaign-server-application}\n\nTo run the upgrade file, apply the following steps:\n\n1. Run **setup.exe**.\n\n   To download this file, connect to the [Software distribution portal](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/campaign.html) using your user credentials. Learn more about Software distribution in [this page](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-cloud/software-distribution/home.html).\n\n1. Select the installation mode: choose **[!UICONTROL Update or repair]** \n1. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]** .\n1. Click **[!UICONTROL Finish]** .\n\n   The installation program then copies the new files.\n\n1. Once the operation is complete, click **[!UICONTROL Finish]** .\n\n### Synchronize resources {#synchronize-resources}\n\nUse the following command line:\n\n**nlserver config -postupgrade -allinstances**\n\nThis will enable you to carry out the following operations:\n\n* Synchronize resources\n* Update schemas\n* update the database\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>This operation should be performed only once, and only on an (**nlserver web**) application server.\n\nThen check whether the synchronization has generated errors or warnings. For more on this, refer to [Resolving upgrade conflicts](#resolving-upgrade-conflicts).\n\n### Restart services {#restart-services}\n\nThe services to be restarted are:\n\n* Web services (IIS):\n\n  **iisreset /start**\n\n* Adobe Campaign service: **net start nlserver6**\n\n## Linux {#in-linux}\n\nOn a Linux environment, follow the steps below to update Adobe Campaign to a new build:\n\n* [Download the updated packages](#obtain-updated-packages),\n* [Perform the update](#perform-an-update),\n* [Reboot the web server](#reboot-the-web-server).\n\n[Learn more about Client Console availability](../../installation/using/client-console-availability-for-windows.md).\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>From build 8757, the third-party library is no longer needed.\n\n### Obtain updated packages {#obtain-updated-packages}\n\nStart by recovering both updated packages of Adobe Campaign: connect to the [Software distribution portal](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/campaign.html) using your user credentials. Learn more about Software distribution in [this page](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-cloud/software-distribution/home.html).\n\nThe file is **nlserver6-v7-XXX.rpm**\n\n### Perform an update {#perform-an-update}\n\n* RPM based distribution (RedHat, SuSe)\n\n  To install them, execute as root:\n\n  ```\n  $rpm -Uvh nlserver6-v7-XXXX.rpm\n  ```\n\n  Where XXX is the version of the file.\n\n  The rpm file has dependencies on packages that you can find on CentOS/Red Hat distributions. If you don't want to use some of these dependencies, you may have to use the \"nodeps\" option of rpm:\n\n  ```\n  rpm --nodeps -Uvh nlserver6-v7-XXXX-0.x86_64.rpm\n  ```\n\n* DEB based distribution (Debian)\n\n  To install them, execute as root:\n\n  ```\n  dpkg -i nlserver6-v7-XXXX-amd64_debX.deb\n  ```\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>Full installation procedures are detailed in [this section](../../installation/using/installing-campaign-standard-packages.md). Resources are synchronized automatically, however you need to make sure no errors occurred. For more on this, refer to [Resolve upgrade conflicts](#resolving-upgrade-conflicts).\n\n### Reboot the web server {#reboot-the-web-server}\n\nYou must shut down Apache for the new library to become applicable.\n\nTo do this, execute the following command:\n\n```\n/etc/init.d/apache stop\n```\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n>\n>* Your script might be called **httpd** instead of **apache**.\n>* You MUST execute this command until you obtain the following reply:\n>\n>   This operation is required in order for Apache to apply the new library.\n\nThen restart Apache:\n\n```\n/etc/init.d/apache start\n```\n\n## Resolve upgrade conflicts {#resolving-upgrade-conflicts}\n\nDuring resource synchronization, the **postupgrade** command enables you to detect whether synchronization has generated errors or warnings.\n\n### View the synchronization result {#view-the-synchronization-result}\n\nThere are two ways of viewing the synchronization result:\n\n* In the command-line interface, errors are materialized by a triple chevron **>>>** and synchronization is stopped automatically. Warnings are materialized by a double chevron **>>** and must be resolved once synchronization is complete. At the end of the postupgrade, a summary is displayed in the command prompt. It can look like this:\n\n  ```\n  2013-04-09 07:48:39.749Z 00002E7A 1 info log =========Summary of the update==========\n  2013-04-09 07:48:39.749Z 00002E7A 1 info log <instance name> instance, 6 warning(s) and 0 error(s) during the update.\n  2013-04-09 07:48:39.749Z 00002E7A 1 warning log The document with identifier 'mobileAppDeliveryFeedback' and type 'xtk:report' is in conflict with the new version.\n  2013-04-09 07:48:39.749Z 00002E7A 1 warning log The document with identifier 'opensByUserAgent' and type 'xtk:report' is in conflict with the new version.\n  2013-04-09 07:48:39.750Z 00002E7A 1 warning log The document with identifier 'deliveryValidation' and type 'nms:webApp' is in conflict with the new version.\n  2013-04-09 07:48:39.750Z 00002E7A 1 warning log Document of identifier 'nms:includeView' and type 'xtk:srcSchema' updated in the database and found in the file system. You will have to merge the two versions manually.\n  \n  ```\n\n  If the warning concerns a conflict of resources, user attention is required to resolve it.\n\n* The **postupgrade_`<server version number>_<time of postupgrade>`.log** log file contains the synchronization result. It is available by default in the following directory: **`<installation directory>/var/<instance/postupgrade`**. Errors and warnings are indicated by the error and warning attributes.\n\n### Resolve conflicts {#resolving-conflicts}\n\nTo resolve conflicts, apply the following process:\n\n1. In the Adobe Campaign tree, go to **[!UICONTROL Administration > Configuration > Package management > Edit conflicts]** .\n1. Select the conflict you want to resolve in the list.\n\nThere are three ways to resolve a conflict:\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Declare as resolved]** : requires user intervention beforehand.\n* **[!UICONTROL Accept the new version]** : recommended if the resources provided with Adobe Campaign have not been changed by the user.\n* **[!UICONTROL Keep the current version]** : means that the update is rejected.\n\n  >[!IMPORTANT]\n  >\n  >If you select this resolution mode, you may not benefit from corrections in the new version.\n\nIf you chose to resolve the conflict manually, proceed as follows:\n\n1. In the lower section of the window, search for the **_conflict_** string to locate the entities with conflicts. The entity installed with the new version contains the **new** argument, the entity that matches the previous version contains the **cus** argument. \n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_production_conflict002.png)\n\n1. Delete the version you don't want to keep. Delete the **_conflict_argument_** string of the entity you are keeping.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_production_conflict003.png)\n\n1. Go to the conflict you have resolved. Click the **[!UICONTROL Actions]** icon and select **[!UICONTROL Declare as resolved]** . \n1. Save your changes: the conflict is now resolved.\n\n### Best practices {#best-practices}\n\nAn update failure may be linked to the database configuration. Make sure the configurations carried out by the technical administrator and the database administrator are compatible.\n\nFor example, a unicode database must not only authorize storage of LATIN1 data, etc.\n\n## Warn the client consoles of the available update {#warn-the-client-consoles-of-the-available-update}\n\n### Windows {#in-windows-1}\n\nOn the machine where the Adobe Campaign application server is installed (**nlserver web**), download and copy the file  **setup-client-6.XXXX.exe** i n **[path of the application]/datakit/nl/eng/jsp**.\n\nThe next time client consoles are connected, a window will inform users about the availability of an update and offer them the possibility of downloading and installing it.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>Make sure the IIS_XPG user has the appropriate read rights for this installation file and refer to the [installation guide](../../installation/using/general-architecture.md) for more information.\n\n### Linux {#in-linux-1}\n\nOn the machine where the Adobe Campaign application server (**nlserver web**) is installed, retrieve the  **setup-client-6.XXXX.exe** package and copy it, saving as **/usr/local/neolane/nl6/datakit/nl/eng/jsp**:\n\n```\n cp setup-client-6.XXXX.exe /usr/local/neolane/nl6/datakit/nl/eng/jsp\n```\n\nThe next time client consoles are connected, a window will inform users about the availability of an update and offer them the possibility of downloading and installing it.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>Make sure the Apache user has the appropriate read rights for this installation file and refer to the [installation guide](../../installation/using/general-architecture.md) for more information.\n","headers":[["title","Upgrading to a new build"],["description","Learn technical steps to upgrade to a new build"],["feature","Monitoring, Upgrade"],["topic-tags","updating-adobe-campaign"]],"sections":[{"section":"Upgrading to a new build (on-premise)","sectionId":"0d6fe9e2-5c5f-4d05-9f1c-155b99ec3bb9","paragraphs":["Before starting the upgrading process, determine and confirm which version of Adobe Campaign is to being upgraded to and consult the Release Notes .","IMPORTANT","Adobe strongly recommends making a database backup on each instance before updating.
