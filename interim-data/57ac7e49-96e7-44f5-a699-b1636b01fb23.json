There are two versions of this tab:\n\n* a simplified version (for **[!UICONTROL Start]** and **[!UICONTROL End]** activities for instance)\n\n  ![](assets/wf-advanced-basic.png)\n\n* a more detailed version (for the **[!UICONTROL Query]** activity, for instance)\n\n  ![](assets/wf-advanced-full.png)\n\nThe fields to be entered in the **[!UICONTROL Advanced]** tab are detailed in the following sections.\n\n## Name {#name}\n\nThis field contains the internal name of the activity.\n\n## Image {#image}\n\nThis field lets you change the image linked to an activity. For more on this, refer to [Change activity images](managing-activity-images.md).\n\n## Execution {#execution}\n\nThis field lets you define the action to be carried out when the task is triggered. There are three possible options:\n\nThese options are generally selected in the cart by right-clicking the activity.\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Normal]**: the activity is executed as usual.\n* **[!UICONTROL Do not activate]**: this task and all the following tasks (in the same branch) are not executed. \n* **[!UICONTROL Activate but do not execute]**: this task and all the following tasks (in the same branch) are automatically stopped. This can be useful if you want to be there when the task is started. To execute the task manually, right-click the activity and select **[!UICONTROL Normal execution]**.\n\n## Affinity {#affinity}\n\nYou can choose to force the execution of a workflow or workflow activity on a specific machine. To do this, you must define one or more propensities at the level of the workflow or the concerned activity.\n\nHigh availability workflow configuration is detailed in this [section](../../installation/using/configuring-campaign-server.md#high-availability-workflows-and-affinities).\n\n\n## Max. execution period {#max--execution-period}\n\nThis field lets you set a warning for when the task takes too long. It won't impact workflow operation. If the task isn't finished by the time the **[!UICONTROL Max. execution period]** is over, the **[!UICONTROL Instance monitoring]** page will show a warning for this workflow. This page is accessed via the **[!UICONTROL Monitoring]** tab of the home page.\n\n## Behavior {#behavior}\n\nThis field lets you define the behavior to be applied for using asynchronous tasks. There are two possible options:\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Several tasks authorized]**: several tasks can be executed at once, even if the first one isn't finished. \n* **[!UICONTROL The current task has priority]**: tasks in progress take priority. As long as a task is in progress, no other task will be executed.\n\n## Time zone {#time-zone}\n\nThis field lets you select the time zone of the activity. For more on this: [Manage time zones](managing-time-zones.md).\n\n## In case of errors {#in-case-of-errors}\n\nThis field lets you define the action to be carried out when the activity has errors. There are two possible options:\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Suspend the process]**: the workflow is stopped automatically. Its status changes to **[!UICONTROL Failed]**. Once the problem is solved, re-start the workflow.\n* **[!UICONTROL Ignore]**: this task and all the following tasks (in the same branch) aren't executed. This can be useful for recurring tasks. If the branch has a scheduler placed upstream, it will start as usual on the next execution date.\n* **[!UICONTROL Abort on error]**: the workflow is stopped automatically and cannot be restarted. Its status changes to **[!UICONTROL Failed]**. \n\n## Initialization script {#initialization-script}\n\nThis field lets you initialize variables or modify activity properties. For more on this, refer to: [JavaScript scripts and templates](javascript-scripts-and-templates.md).\n\n## Comment {#comment}\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL Comment]** field is a free field that lets you add a description.\n","headers":[["title","Advanced parameters"],["description","Advanced parameters"],["feature","Workflows, Data Management"]],"sections":[{"section":"Advanced parameters","sectionId":"71adfcb4-dffd-4eb8-b4aa-b8b37273a86a","paragraphs":["The properties screen of an activity has an Advanced tab that lets you define a behavior in case of errors, the execution period for the activity; and lets you enter an initialization script.
