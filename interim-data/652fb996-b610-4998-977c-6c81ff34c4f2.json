These options allow you to select the label of your choice to create a list, and later, the folder in which it will be saved. The label can also be automatically generated by inserting dynamic fields or a script. The different dynamic fields are available in the pop-up menu to the right of the label.\n\n![](assets/s_user_segmentation_update_list_calc.png)\n\nIf the list already exists, recipients will be added to the existing content, unless you check the **[!UICONTROL Purge the list if it exists (otherwise add to the list)]** option.

The list will initially be created from the results of the query. It will then be updated every time it is launched from the workflow. It may, for example, be used regularly for targeted promotional offers for campaigns.\n\n1.

Select the **[!UICONTROL Create the list if necessary (Calculated name)]** option to show that the list will be created once the first workflow has been executed, then updated with the following executions.\n1. Select the folder where you wish to save the list.\n1. Enter a label for the list. You can insert dynamic fields to automatically generate the name from the list. In this example, the list has the same name as the query to easily identify its content.\n1. Leave the **[!UICONTROL Purge the list if it exists (otherwise add to the list)]** option checked to delete recipients that do not match the targeting criteria and to insert the new ones into the list.\n1.
