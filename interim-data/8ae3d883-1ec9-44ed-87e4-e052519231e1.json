Refer to [Start and end](start-and-end.md).\n* **Fork**: allow you to activate all outbound transitions. Refer to the [Fork](fork.md) section.\n* **Appointment**: lets you wait for several tasks started at the same time to be completed before proceeding. Refer to the [Fork](fork.md) section.\n* **Scheduler**: lets you define a workflow execution schedule. Refer to [Scheduler](scheduler.md).\n* **Test**: enables a transition based on a test result. Refer to [Test](test.md).\n* **Wait**: enables the outbound transition after a given time limit. Refer to [Wait](wait.md).\n* **Time constraint**: lets you pause a task for a set period. Refer to [Time constraint](time-constraint.md).\n* **Sub-workflow**: lets you execute another workflow. Refer to [Sub-workflow](sub-workflow.md).\n* **Jumps**: lets you implement transitions without links. Refer to [Jump (start point and end point)](jump-start-point-and-end-point.md).\n* **External signal**: lets you enable the outbound transition after receiving an external signal. Refer to the [External signal](external-signal.md) section.\n* **Approval**: lets you send an email to an operator or a group of operators and wait for approval to continue with the execution. Refer to the [Approval](approval.md) section.\n* **Alert**: lets you send a warning to an operator or group of operators. Refer to the [Alert](alert.md) section.\n* **Task**: lets you configure task execution.
