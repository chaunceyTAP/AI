[Learn more](#script-activity)\n\n* Add an external script to execute on the server or client side. [Learn more](#external-script)\n\n* Call a report with a **Jump** activity. [Learn more](#calling-up-another-report)\n\n* Add a URL parameter to a report to make it more accessible. [Learn more](#calling-up-another-report)\n\n* Add variables to be used in the context of the report. [Learn more](#adding-variables)\n\n## Working with scripts {#adding-a-script}\n\n### Reference external scripts {#external-script}\n\nYou can reference JavaScript codes that will be executed on the client and/or server side when the report page is called up. \n\nTo do this:\n\n1. Edit the [report properties](../../reporting/using/properties-of-the-report.md) and click the **[!UICONTROL Scripts]**.\n1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add]** and select the script to be referenced.\n1. Then select the execution mode.\n\n   If you add several scripts, use the arrows of the toolbar to define their execution sequence.\n\n   ![](assets/reporting_custom_js.png)\n\nFor normal execution on the client side, the referenced scripts must be written in JavaScript and need to be compatible with common browsers. For more on this, refer to [this section](../../web/using/web-forms-answers.md).\n\n### Adding a Script activity {#script-activity}\n\nWhen [designing your report](../../reporting/using/creating-a-new-report.md#modelizing-the-chart), use the **[!UICONTROL Script]** activity to process data and easily create complex queries that don't enable SQL language. You can directly enter your query in the script window.\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL Texts]** tab enables you to define text strings. They may then be used with the following syntax: **$(Identifier)**. For more on using texts, refer to [Adding a header and a footer](../../reporting/using/element-layout.md#adding-a-header-and-a-footer).\n\n>[!CAUTION]\n>\n>We do NOT recommend using JavaScript code to create aggregates.\n\nTo create a history of your report, add the following line to your JavaScript query in order to save your archived data:\n\n```\nif( ctx.@_historyId.toString().length == 0 )\n```\n\nOtherwise, only current data will be displayed.\n\n## Adding a URL parameter {#defining-additional-settings}\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL Parameters]** tab of the [report properties](../../reporting/using/properties-of-the-report.md) lets you define additional settings for the report: these settings will be passed into the URL during the call up.\n\n>[!CAUTION]\n>\n>For security reasons, these parameters must be used with great caution.\n\nTo create a new setting:\n\n1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Add]** button and enter the name of the setting.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_properties_09a.png)\n\n1. If necessary, specify whether or not the setting will be mandatory.\n\n1. Select the type of setting you want to create: **[!UICONTROL Filter]** or **[!UICONTROL Variable]**.\n\n   The **[!UICONTROL Filter entities]** option lets you use a field of the database as a parameter.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_properties_09b.png)\n\n   The data is recovered directly at the entity level: **ctx/recipient/@account**.\n\n   The **[!UICONTROL Variable]** option lets you create or select a variable which will be passed as a parameter of the URL and can be used in the filters.\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL Response HTTP headers]** allows you to prevent clickjacking when including your report's page in an HTML page using iframe. To avoid clickjacking, you can choose the **[!UICONTROL X-Frame-options header]** behavior:\n\n* **[!UICONTROL None]**: The report will have no **[!UICONTROL X-Frame-options header]**.\n* **[!UICONTROL Same as origin]**: Set by default for new reports and republished reports. The hostname will be the same as the report's URL.\n* **[!UICONTROL Deny]**: The report cannot be included in an HTML page using iframe.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_properties_09c.png)\n\n## Adding variables {#adding-variables}\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL Variables]** tab contains the list of variables configured in the report. These variables are exposed in the context of the report and can be used in calculations.\n\nClick the **[!UICONTROL Add]** button to create a new variable.\n\nTo view the definition of a variable, select it and click the **[!UICONTROL Detail...]** button.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_advuser_report_properties_10.png)\n\n## Use Case: use variables and parameters in a report\n\nIn the video example below, you will learn how to  add a \"_type\" parameter to create different views of a report, based on the value of this attribute.\n\n<!--\n![](assets/do-not-localize/how-to-video.png) [Discover this feature in video](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/classic/how-to/add-url-parameter-in-acv6.html?playlist=/ccx/v1/collection/product/campaign/classic/segment/business-practitioners/explevel/intermediate/applaunch/how-to-4/collection.ccx.js&ref=helpx.adobe.com)-->\n\n\n## Calling up another report {#calling-up-another-report}\n\nA **Jump** activity is like a transition without an arrow: it lets you go from one activity to another or access another report.\n","headers":[["title","Advanced capabilities"],["description","Learn more about advanced capabilities when working with reports"],["feature","Reporting, Monitoring"]],"sections":[{"section":"Advanced capabilities","sectionId":"8e5c8bf0-1f28-445a-9e8a-671ad84dbc55","paragraphs":["As a technical user, in addition to general properties, you can leverage advanced capabilities to configure your reports, such as:","Create complex queries to process data in a Script activity.
