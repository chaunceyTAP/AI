It enables you to analyze and measure data, calculate statistics, simplify and optimize report creation and calculation. In addition to this, Marketing Analytics enables you to create reports and build target populations. Once these are identified, they are stored in lists that can be used in Adobe Campaign (targeting, segmentation, etc.).\n\nCubes are used for generating certain built-in reports, including delivery reports (delivery tracking, clicks, opens, etc.). Reports based on cubes may only be used as a standard for data volumes under 5 million fact lines.\n\nYou can extend the database exploration and analysis capacities while making it easier for final users to configure reports and tables: all they need to do is select an existing (fully configured) cube when creating their report or table to process calculations, measures and statistics.\n\nOnce they have been created and configured, cubes are used in report query boxes and Web applications. They can be used and manipulated within pivot tables.\n\n>[!CAUTION]\n>\n>**Marketing Analytics** is an Adobe Campaign module. It needs to be installed on your instance so that you can use the capabilities described below.\n\nUse the Campaign Marketing Analytics module to:\n\n1. Create cubes\n\n    * aggregate and store data in a work table to pre-calculate indicators based on user needs,\n    * reduce the volume of data involved in the various calculations used for reports and queries, thus significantly optimizing indicator calculation times,\n    * simplify access to data, enable users to manipulate data (whether it is pre-aggregated or not) depending on various dimensions.\n\n1. Create pivot tables\n\n    * explore calculated data, configured measures,\n    * select the data to display as well as its display mode,\n    * personalize the measures and indicators used,\n    * offer interactive analysis tools to users with a non-technical background.\n\n1. Build a query using data calculated and aggregated in a Cube.\n1.
