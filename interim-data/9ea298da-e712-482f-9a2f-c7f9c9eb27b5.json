To do this, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Create a new delivery template - or duplicate an existing one. For more on Delivery templates, refer to [this page](../../delivery/using/about-templates.md).\n1. Edit the **Properties** of this template.\n1. In the **[!UICONTROL Advanced]** tab, set the **[!UICONTROL Content editing mode]** to **DCE**. \n1.

To also access the assets in your AEM Assets library, you must synchronize AEM Assets and Adobe Experience Cloud.
