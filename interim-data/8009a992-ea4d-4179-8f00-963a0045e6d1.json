This steps also allows you to select the segments to export and specify additional XDM fields to include.\n\nFor more on this, refer to the [Destinations documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/catalog/email-marketing/adobe-campaign.html).\n\nAfter the Destination has been configured, Adobe Experience Platform creates a tab-delimited .txt or .csv file in the storage location that you provided. This operation is scheduled and performed once per 24h.\n\nYou can now configure a Campaign Classic workflow to ingest the segment into Campaign.\n\n## Create an import workflow in Campaign Classic\n\nOnce Campaign Classic has been configured as a Destination, you need to build a dedicated workflow to import the file that has been exported by Adobe Experience Platform.\n\nTo do this, you need to add and configure a **[!UICONTROL File transfer]** activity. For more on how to configure this activity, refer to [this section](../../workflow/using/file-transfer.md).\n\n   ![](assets/rtcdp-file-transfer.png)\n\nYou can then build your workflow according to your needs (update the database using the segment data, send a cross-channel deliveries to the segment, etc.)\n\nAs an example, the workflow below downloads the file from your storage location on a daily basis, then updates Campaign database with the segment data.\n\n   ![](assets/rtcdp-workflow.png)\n","headers":[["title","Ingest Adobe Experience Platform segments into Campaign"],["description","Learn how to ingest Adobe Experience Platform audiences into Campaign Classic"],["feature","Experience Platform Integration"]],"sections":[{"section":"Ingest Adobe Experience Platform segments into Campaign","sectionId":"e1ff9eb2-fc42-4e77-8c44-e5faa57b42e7","paragraphs":["To ingest Adobe Experience Platform audiences into Campaign and use them in your workflows, you first need to connect Adobe Campaign as an Adobe Experience Platform Destination and configure it with the segment to export.","Once the Destination has been configured, data will be exported to your storage location, and you will need to build a dedicated workflow in Campaign Classic to ingest it."]},{"section":"Connect Adobe Campaign as a Destination","sectionId":"79896368-47da-40c7-8010-1889b00ebe0a","paragraphs":["In Adobe Experience platform, configure a connection with Adobe Campaign by selecting a storage location for the exported segments.
