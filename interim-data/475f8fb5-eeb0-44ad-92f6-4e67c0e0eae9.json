To correct this, you need to update your quarantine table in Campaign by finding and removing these recipients, or changing their **[!UICONTROL Status]** to **[!UICONTROL Valid]** so that the nightly clean-up workflow will remove them. \n\nTo find the recipients who were affected by this issue, or in case this happens again with any other ISP, please see the instructions below.\n\n## Process to update\n\nYou will need to run a query on your quarantine table to filter out all Apple recipients - which includes, @icloud.com, @me.com, @mac.com - who were potentially affected by the outage so they can be removed from the quarantine list, and included in future Campaign email deliveries.\n\nBased on the timeframe of the incident, below are the recommended guidelines for this query.\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n>\n>These dates/times are based on the Eastern Standard time zone (EST).
