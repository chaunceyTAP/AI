It is the input point for the definition of the schema.\n\n## Use and context of use {#use-and-context-of-use-9}\n\nSchema presentation is available in [About schema reference](../../../configuration/using/about-schema-reference.md) and [Schema structure](../../../configuration/using/schema-structure.md).\n\n## Attribute description {#attribute-description-14}\n\n* **created (datetime)**: this attribute provides information on the date and time of schema creation. It has a \"Date Time\" form. The values displayed are taken from the server. The time is shown in UTC format. \n* **createdBy-id (long)**: is the identifier of the operator who created the schema. \n* **desc (string)**: schema description\n* **entitySchema (string)**: basic schema which syntax and approval are based on (by default for Adobe Campaign: xtk:srcSchema). When you save the current schema, Adobe Campaign will approve its grammar with the schema declared in the @xtkschema attribute.\n* **extendedSchema (string)**: receives the name of the out-of-the-box schema which the current schema extension is based on. The form is \"namespace:name\". \n* **img (string)**: icon linked to the schema (may be defined in the schema creation wizard). \n* **label (string)**: schema label.\n* **labelSingular (string)**: label (singular) for display in the interface. \n* **lastModified (datetime)**: this attribute provides information on the date and time of the last modification. It has a \"Date Time\" form. The values displayed are taken from the server. The time is shown in UTC format. \n* **library (boolean)**: use of the schema as a library and not an entity. This schema may therefore be referenced by other schemas thanks to the \"@ref\" and \"@template\" attributes.\n* **mappingType (string)**:\n\n    * \"sql\": database mapping\n    * \"textFile\": text file mapping\n    * \"xmlFile\": XML format text file mapping\n    * \"binaryFile\": binary file mapping\n\n* **modifiedBy-id (long)**: matches the identifier of the operator who changed the schema. \n* **name (string)**: unique schema name.\n* **namespace (string)**: namespace of the schema (default: nms, xtk, nl). When creating a new schema for a project, we recommend that you use a dedicated namespace.\n* **useRecycleBin (boolean)**: activates the trash feature in the application. Deleted records will be placed in the trash before final deletion. This function is only available in \"Delivery\" mode.\n* **view (boolean)**: if it is activated (@view=\"true\"), the schema will be used as a view. The database structure update wizard will not take the schema into account. This option is mainly used for referencing external tables.\n* **xtkschema (string)**: name of the schema which defines schema grammar (xtk:srcSchema by default).\n\n## Examples {#examples-11}\n\n`<srcschema>` element of the \"nms:delivery\" out of the box schema\n\n```\n\n<srcSchema desc=\"Defines all the settings of a delivery (or delivery template).\"  \n           entitySchema=\"xtk:srcSchema\" img=\"nms:campaign.png\" implements=\"xtk:persist\" \n           label=\"Diffusions\" labelSingular=\"Diffusion\" md5=\"DCD2164CD0276B1DCA6E1C9E2A75EC04\"\n           name=\"delivery\" namespace=\"nms\" useRecycleBin=\"true\" xtkschema=\"xtk:srcSchema\">\n```\n","headers":[["title","Elements and attributes - srcschema element"],["description","Elements and attributes"],["feature","Schema Extension"],["topic-tags","schema-reference"]],"sections":[{"section":"srcschema element","sectionId":"51009abc-5458-4523-b239-9bed52e3344d","paragraphs":[]},{"section":"Content model","sectionId":"1a7555e1-8d1e-4ff2-a5d7-a2f182ca69ca","paragraphs":["srcSchema:==(attribute | createdBy | data | element | enumeration | help | interface | methods | modifiedBy)"]},{"section":"Attributes","sectionId":"75131102-0af3-4b05-ab99-b79237c66a44","paragraphs":["created (datetime), createdBy-id (long), desc (string), entitySchema (string), extendedSchema (string), img (string), implements (string), label (string), labelSingular (string), lastModified (datetime), library (boolean), mappingType (string), modifiedBy-id (long), name (string), namespace (string), useRecycleBin (boolean), view (boolean), xtkschema (string)"]},{"section":"Parents","sectionId":"464e5fc7-3cab-415b-b01a-26270269c362","paragraphs":["None"]},{"section":"Children","sectionId":"0f9ed88c-d911-4e6d-b504-f27f4cfef0e5","paragraphs":["<attribute>\n<createdby>\n<data>\n<element>\n<enumeration>\n<help>\n<interface>\n<methods>\n<modifiedby>"]},{"section":"Description","sectionId":"d0614275-20c3-4a4e-9b3c-9d9746c0f316","paragraphs":["The <srcschema> is the root element of a schema.
