This document will help you migrate connectors that are still running on the old system to the recommended SMPP connector.\n\n>[!CAUTION]\n>\n>This migration is not mandatory but recommended by Adobe and will ensure you are running on the latest supported version of the software.\n\n## About SMS connectors {#about-sms-connectors}\n\nThe following connectors are deprecated as of release 20.2:\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Generic SMPP]** (SMPP version 3.4 supporting binary mode)\n* **[!UICONTROL Sybase365]** (SAP SMS 365)\n* **[!UICONTROL CLX Communications]**\n* **[!UICONTROL Tele2]**\n* **[!UICONTROL O2]**\n* **[!UICONTROL iOS]**\n\nDeprecated capabilities are still available and supported, but they will not be further enhanced. We recommend using the **[!UICONTROL Extended generic SMPP]** connector.\n\nFor more information on deprecated and removed features, refer to this [page](../../rn/using/deprecated-features.md).\n\nOld SMS connectors are using the Java SMS connector that overloads the web process. Migrating to the new **[!UICONTROL Extended Generic SMPP]** connector will move this load to the MTA which can support it.\n\n## Migrating to the Extended Generic SMPP connector {#migrating-extended-generic-smpp}\n\n>[!CAUTION]\n>\n>Even if you can transpose the parameters, configuring the **[!UICONTROL Extended Generic SMPP]** connector requires you to talk with your provider who will give you the information needed to fill in the rest of the parameters. For more on this, refer to this [page](sms-protocol.md).\n\nFirst, you will need to create a new **[!UICONTROL Extended Generic SMPP]** external account and then you might be able to transpose some of the parameters.
