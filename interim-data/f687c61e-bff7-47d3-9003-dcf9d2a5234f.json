For a deeper dive on deliverability, refer to the [Adobe Deliverability Best Practice Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/deliverability-learn/deliverability-best-practice-guide/introduction.html).\n\n## Pending status {#pending-status}\n\nAfter confirming your delivery, you can see that the status of your delivery is **[!UICONTROL Pending]**. This status means that the execution process is waiting on the availability of some resources.\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL Pending]** status can first mean that your delivery has been scheduled and is pending until the given date. For more on this, refer to the [Delivery scheduling](steps-sending-the-delivery.md#scheduling-the-delivery-sending) section.\n\nIf your delivery is not being sent and its status remains **[!UICONTROL Pending]**, it can be the result of:\n\n* The MTA (Message Transfer Agent), which runs modules and processes on the delivery server and which manages email sending, may have not been started, or may need to be restarted.\n\n    To check this and to start the module if necessary, apply the following steps:\n\n    >[!NOTE]\n    >\n    >This operation can be performed with an **on-premise** or **hybrid** hosting model with access the the Campaign server (see [hosting models](../../installation/using/hosting-models.md)).\n\n    1. Check that your `mta@<instance>` modules are launched on your MTA servers.\n\n        ```\n        nlserver pdump\n        HH:MM:SS > Application server for Adobe Campaign Classic (X.Y.Z YY.R build nnnn@SHA1) of DD/MM/YYYY\n        [...]\n        mta@<instance-name> (9268) - 23.0 Mb\n        [...]\n        ```\n\n    1. If the MTA is not listed, start it with the following command:\n\n        ```\n        nlserver start mta@<instance-name>\n        ```\n\n        >[!NOTE]\n        >\n        >Replace `<instance-name>` with the name of your instance (production, development, etc.). The instance name is identified via the configuration files: `[path of application]nl6/conf/config-<instance-name>.xml`\n\n* The delivery may be using an affinity not configured on the sending server.\n    \n    In this case, check the configuration of the traffic management (IP affinity) and use the **[!UICONTROL Managing affinities with IP addresses]** field to link deliveries to the MTA that manages the affinity. For more information on affinities, refer to [this section](../../installation/using/configure-delivery-settings.md).\n\n* When too many campaigns are running, the delivery status remains in 'Pending' status.\n\n    The limit of simultaneous campaigns is defined in the **[!UICONTROL NmsOperation_LimitConcurrency]** option. Default value is 10.\n    \n    Learn more about options in [this page](../../installation/using/configuring-campaign-options.md).\n\n\n**Related topics:**\n\n* [Delivery logs and history](#delivery-logs-and-history)\n* [Understanding delivery failures](understanding-delivery-failures.md)\n* [Delivery failure types and reasons](understanding-delivery-failures.md#delivery-failure-types-and-reasons)\n",
