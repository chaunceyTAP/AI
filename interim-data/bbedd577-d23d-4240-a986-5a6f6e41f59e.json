Follow the steps below to configure access to [!DNL Vertica Analytics].\n\n1. Configure [!DNL Vertica Analytics] on [CentOS](#vertica-centos), [Windows](#vertica-windows) or [Debian](#vertica-debian)\n1. Configure the [!DNL Vertica Analytics] [external account](#vertica-external) in Campaign\n\n![](assets/snowflake_3.png)\n\n## [!DNL Vertica Analytics] on CentOS {#vertica-centos}\n\nTo configure [!DNL Vertica Analytics] on CentOS, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Download the ODBC drivers for [!DNL Vertica Analytics]. [Click here](https://www.vertica.com/download/vertica/client-drivers/) and download the latest Linux RPM.\n\n1. You then need to install unixODBC with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    yum search unixODBC\n    yum install unixODBC.x86_64\n    ```\n\n1. If you have previously installed the [!DNL Vertica Analytics] Server, an ODBC driver will already be installed. In this case, update the drive as follows:\n\n    ```\n    #Switch to root\n    sudo su\n \n    #Install the package (add --force to update it)\n    rpm -Uvh vertica-client-x.x.x-x.x86_64.rpm [--force]\n \n    #Open odbcinst.ini\n    vi /etc/odbcinst.ini\n \n    #Add a section for Vertica Analytics and save\n    [VerVertica Analyticstica]\n    Description = Vertica Analytics ODBC Driver\n    Driver = /opt/vertica/lib64/libverticaodbc.so\n \n    #Open odbc.ini\n    vi /etc/odbc.ini\n \n    #Add your DSN in ODBC Data Sources section, for example:\n    [ODBC Data Sources]\n    VMart = \"VMart database on Vertica Analytics\"\n \n    #Add a DSN definition section below, for example:\n    [VMart]\n    Description = Vmart Database\n    Driver = Vertica Analytics\n    Database = VMart\n    Servername = # The name of the server where Vertica Analytics is installed.

In Adobe Campaign, you can then configure your [!DNL Vertica Analytics] external account. For more on how to configure your external account, refer to [this section](#vertica-external).\n\n## [!DNL Vertica Analytics] on Windows {#vertica-windows}\n\n1. Download the [ODBC driver for Windows](https://www.vertica.com/download/vertica/client-drivers/). To install the driver for Windows, you will need to enable .NET Framework 3.5 or the installation wizard will try to automatically enable and download it.\n\n1. Configure the ODBC driver in Windows. For more on this, refer to [this page](https://www.vertica.com/docs/9.2.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/ConnectingToVertica/ClientODBC/SettingUpADSN.htm)\n\n1. In Adobe Campaign, you can then configure your [!DNL Vertica Analytics] external account. For more on how to configure your external account, refer to [this section](#vertical-external).\n\n## [!DNL Vertica Analytics] on Debian {#vertica-debian}\n\n1. Download the ODBC drivers for [!DNL Vertica Analytics]. [Click here](https://sfc-repo.snowflakecomputing.com/odbc/linux/latest/index.html) start downloading.\n\n1. You then need to install unixODBC with the following command:\n\n    ```\n    apt-get install unixODBC\n    ```\n\n1. If you have previously installed the [!DNL Vertica Analytics] Server, an ODBC driver will already be installed. In this case, update the drive as follows:\n\n    ```\n    #Switch to root\n    sudo su\n \n    #Move or copy the downloaded file and change to /root\n    mv vertica_9.3..xx_odbc_x86_64_linux.tar.gz /\n    cd /\n \n    #Uncompress the file you downloaded\n    tar vzxf vertica_9.3..xx_odbc_x86_64_linux.tar.gz\n \n    #Remove the tar.gz since it is not needed anymore\n    rm vertica_9.3..xx_odbc_x86_64_linux.tar.gz\n \n    #Open odbcinst.ini\n    vi /etc/odbcinst.ini\n \n    #Add a section for Vertica Analytics and save\n    [Vertica Analytics]\n    Description = Vertica Analytics ODBC Driver\n    Driver = /opt/vertica/lib64/libverticaodbc.so\n \n    #Open odbc.ini\n    vi /etc/odbc.ini\n \n    #Add your DSN in ODBC Data Sources section, for example:\n    [ODBC Data Sources]\n    VMart = \"VMart database on Vertica Analytics\"\n \n    #Add a DSN definition section below, for example:\n    [VMart]\n    Description = Vmart Database\n    Driver = Vertica Analytics\n    Database = VMart\n    Servername = # The name of the server where Vertica Analytics is installed.

In Adobe Campaign, you can then configure your [!DNL Vertica Analytics] external account. For more on how to configure your external account, refer to [this section](#vertica-external).\n\n## [!DNL Vertica Analytics] external account {#vertica-external}\n\nYou need to create a [!DNL Vertica Analytics] external account to connect your Campaign instance to your [!DNL Vertica Analytics] external database.\n\n1. From Campaign **[!UICONTROL Explorer]**, click **[!UICONTROL Administration]** '>' **[!UICONTROL Platform]** '>' **[!UICONTROL External accounts]**.\n\n1. Click **[!UICONTROL New]**.\n\n1. Select **[!UICONTROL External database]** as your external account's **[!UICONTROL Type]**.\n\n1. Configure the **[!UICONTROL Vertica Analytics]** external account, you must specify:\n\n    * **[!UICONTROL Type]**: [!DNL Vertica Analytics]\n\n    * **[!UICONTROL Server]**: URL of the [!DNL Vertica Analytics] server\n\n    * **[!UICONTROL Account]**: Name of the user\n\n    * **[!UICONTROL Password]**: User account password\n\n    * **[!UICONTROL Database]**: Name of the database\n\n    ![](assets/vertica.png)\n\nThe connector supports the following options:\n\n| Option   |  Description |\n|---|---|\n|  TimeZoneName |  By default empty, which means that the system time zone of the Campaign Classic app server is used.
