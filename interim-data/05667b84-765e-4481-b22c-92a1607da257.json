You can then monitor and measure the productivity and performance of all marketing activities.\n\n## Concepts and terminology {#core-concepts}\n\nIn the context of Adobe Campaign Marketing Resource Management, the following concepts and terms are specific:\n\n* **Task**\n\n  A task corresponds to an action to be carried out in the context of a campaign.
