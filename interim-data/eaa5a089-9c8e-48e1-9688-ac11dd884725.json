The table is generated a few minutes after the tracking logs are retrieved. If the indicators are up-to-date, the results will be the same as for the indicators of the **Tracking indicators** report.

This indicator is only used for SMS deliveries and must not be used for other types of deliveries (not to be confused with the **@success** and **@processed** indicators).\n\n## Indicator synchronization {#indicator-synchronization}\n\nIf you experience desynchronization or inconsistency for certain indicators, select the concerned delivery in the Adobe Campaign explorer, right-click and choose **[!UICONTROL Action>Recompute delivery and tracking indicators]**. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]**, then click **[!UICONTROL Finish]**.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_recalculate_indicators.png)\n\n## Tracking opens {#tracking-opens-}\n\nIn order for Adobe Campaign to detect message opens, the recipient must download the images in the email. HTML and Multipart/Alternative emails include a 0 pixel image, which enable you to detect messages which have been opened. Since messages in text format do not include any images, it is impossible to detect whether they have been opened or not. Values calculated based on message opens are always estimates, due to the error margin linked to image display.\n\n## Targeted persons / recipients {#targeted-persons---recipients}\n\nIn some reports, Adobe Campaign differentiates targeted persons and targeted recipients.\n\nTargeted recipients are all the recipients whom the delivery was sent to.\n\nThe number of persons includes targeted recipients plus all persons whom the email was forwarded to. Each time there is an open or a click in a new browser (which the message has not yet been opened in), another person is added to the statistics.\n\nFor instance, if you receive an email (sent by Adobe Campaign) at work and open or click in it, you will be counted as a targeted recipient (i.e. recipient=1, person=1). If you forward this email to two friends, the number of targeted recipients will still equal one, while the number of persons will equal three. Value 3 coincides with each open/click in a new browser.\n","headers":[["title","Indicator calculation"],["description","Indicator calculation"],["feature","Reporting, Monitoring"]],"sections":[{"section":"Indicator calculation","sectionId":"a7b9587a-0804-4e47-b2b9-ec4a2628c599","paragraphs":[]},{"section":"User activities","sectionId":"635f5f3d-ebd0-4251-aecd-7512af0964b7","paragraphs":["TABLE: Label Field name Indicator description Indicator calculation formula Opens @opens Sum of all @totalClicks with a URL primary key equal to 1. sum(Iif([@url-id]=1, @totalClicks, 0)) Clicks @clicks Sum of all @totalClicks with a URL type equal to \"Email click\". sum(Iif([url/@type]=1, @totalClicks, 0)) Transactions @transactions Sum of all @totalClicks with a URL type equal to \"Transaction\". sum(Iif([url/@type]=5, @totalClicks, 0))","This report is based on the Consolidated tracking table (nms:trackingStats).
