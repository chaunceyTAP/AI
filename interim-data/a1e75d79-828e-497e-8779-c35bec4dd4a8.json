A **schema** is an XML document associated with a database table. It defines data structure and describes the SQL definition of the table:\n\n* The name of the table\n* Fields\n* Indexes\n* Links with other tables\n\nIt also describes the XML structure used to store data:\n\n* Elements and attributes\n* Hierarchy of elements\n* Element and attribute types\n* Default values\n* Labels, descriptions, and other properties.\n\nSchemas enable you to define an entity in the database. There is a schema for each entity.\n\nThe following illustration shows the location of schemas in the Adobe Campaign data system:\n\n![](assets/reference_schema_intro.png)\n\n## Syntax of schemas {#syntax-of-schemas}\n\nThe root element of the schema is **`<srcschema>`**. It contains the **`<element>`** and **`<attribute>`** sub-elements.\n\nThe first **`<element>`** sub-element coincides with the root of the entity.\n\n```\n<srcSchema name=\"recipient\" namespace=\"cus\">\n  <element name=\"recipient\">  \n    <attribute name=\"lastName\"/>\n    <attribute name=\"email\"/>\n    <element name=\"location\">\n      <attribute name=\"city\"/>\n   </element>\n  </element>\n</srcSchema>\n```\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>The root element of the entity has the same name as the schema.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_schema_and_entity.png)\n\nThe **`<element>`** tags define the names of entity elements. **`<attribute>`** tags of the schema define the names of the attributes in the **`<element>`** tags which they have been linked to.\n\n## Identification of a schema {#identification-of-a-schema}\n\nA data schema is identified by its name and its namespace.\n\nA namespace lets you group a set of schemas by area of interest. For example, the **cus** namespace is used for customer-specific configuration (**customers**).\n\nThe identification key of a schema is a string built using the namespace and the name separated by a colon; for example: **cus:recipient**.\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n>\n>The name of the namespace must be concise and must contain only authorized characters in accordance with XML naming rules.\n>\n>Identifiers must not begin with numeric characters.\n>\n>The following namespaces are reserved for descriptions of the system entities required for the operation of the Adobe Campaign application and must not be used: **xtk**, **nl**, **nms**, **ncm**, **temp**, **ncl**, **crm**, **xxl**.\n\n","headers":[["title","Get started with schemas in Adobe Campaign"],["description","Learn how work with schemas and extend the conceptual data model of the Adobe Campaign database"],["feature","Schema Extension"]],"sections":[{"section":"Get started with schemas","sectionId":"71564b1d-7903-449e-8ca5-af51d8343d51","paragraphs":[]},{"section":"What is a schema","sectionId":"4f5feafe-9100-466a-a6d9-faa5e981433f","paragraphs":["This chapter describes how to configure extension schemas in order to extend the conceptual data model of the Adobe Campaign database.","For a better understanding of Campaign built-in tables and their interaction, refer to the Campaign Classic data model.","In Adobe Campaign, the physical and logical structure of the data carried in the application is described in XML.
