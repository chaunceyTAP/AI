Configuration depends on the data to be analyzed and on the desired rendering.\n\n## Analyze data in the database {#analyzing-data-in-the-database}\n\nThe descriptive analysis wizard can be launched via the **[!UICONTROL Tools > Descriptive analysis]** menu: in this case, the analysis concerns recipients by default (**nms:recipient**). It applies to all the data in the Adobe Campaign database.\n\n![](assets/reporting_descriptive_wz_launch.png)\n\nTo analyze a table other than the standard recipients one (**nms:recipient**), click the **[!UICONTROL Advanced settings...]** link in the last stage of the wizard and select the table that matches your settings, in this case **cus:individual**:\n\n![](assets/reporting_descriptive_other_schema.png)\n\nIf you want to produce statistics on part of the data, you can define a filter: to do this, click the **[!UICONTROL Advanced settings...]** link and define the filter to apply, as shown below:\n\n![](assets/reporting_descriptive_wz_filter.png)\n\nThe analysis will only concern database recipients aged 16 and over and living in London.\n\n## Analyze a set of data {#analyzing-a-set-of-data}\n\nYou can use the descriptive analysis wizard via a different context: a list, a workflow transition, one or more deliveries, a selection of recipients, etc.\n\nIt is accessible via several nodes of the Adobe Campaign tree that point to the recipient table.\n\nOpen the descriptive analysis wizard by selecting items and right-clicking. Only the selected data will be analyzed.\n\n![](assets/reporting_descriptive_from_recipients.png)\n\n* For a set of **recipients**, select the recipients to be analyzed, then right-click and select **[!UICONTROL Actions > Explore...]**, as shown above. If a filter is applied to the list of recipients, only its content will be analyzed.\n\n  To select all the recipients in the folder or the current filter, use the CTRL+A shortcut. This means that even recipients not shown will be selected.\n\n  For an example of the descriptive analysis of recipients, refer to: [Qualitative data analysis](../../reporting/using/use-cases.md#qualitative-data-analysis).\n\n* In the context of a **workflow**, place the cursor on a transition that points towards the recipients table, right-click and select **[!UICONTROL Analyze target]**. For more on this, refer to the example in [Analyze a transition target in a workflow](../../reporting/using/use-cases.md#analyzing-a-transition-target-in-a-workflow).\n* For **lists**, select one or more lists and apply the same process as for recipients.\n* In the context of a **delivery**, select the deliveries whose target you want to analyze, right-click and select **[!UICONTROL Actions > Explore the target]**, as shown below:\n\n  ![](assets/reporting_descriptive_from_deliveries.png)\n\n  Examples of descriptive analyses for deliveries are provided here: [Analyze a population](../../reporting/using/use-cases.md#analyzing-a-population) and here: [Analyze recipient tracking logs](../../reporting/using/use-cases.md#analyzing-recipient-tracking-logs).\n\n## Configure the qualitative distribution template {#configuring-the-qualitative-distribution-template}\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL Qualitative distribution]** template lets you create statistics on all types of data (e.g. company name, email domain).\n\nConfiguration options available for a report created via the **[!UICONTROL Qualitative distribution]** template are detailed in [Display data in the table](#displaying-data-in-the-table). A full example is detailed in [Analyze a population](../../reporting/using/use-cases.md#analyzing-a-population).\n\nWhen you use the descriptive analysis wizard to analyze your data, the available options depend on the chosen settings. These are detailed below.\n\n### Data binning {#data-binning}\n\nWhen you select the variables to display, you can define data binning, in other words configure grouping criteria for the selected data. \n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_report_wizard_031.png)\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>When the field concerned by the calculation is computed using an aggregate, check **[!UICONTROL The data is already aggregated]** to improve performances.\n\nThe options will differ depending on the content of the field:\n\n* **[!UICONTROL None]** : this option lets you display all the values available for the variable, without binning.\n\n  >[!CAUTION]\n  >\n  >This option should be used with care: it can have a major impact on the report and on machine performance.\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Auto]** : this option lets you display the n most frequently represented values. They are calculated automatically and each represent a percentage of the variables compared to the number of bins. For numerical values, Adobe Campaign automatically generates n classes to sort the data into.\n* **[!UICONTROL Manual]** : this option operates like the **[!UICONTROL Auto]** option, except that you can set these values manually. To do this, click the **[!UICONTROL Add]** button to the right of the value table.\n\n  Values can be initialized automatically by Adobe Campaign before personalization: to do this, enter the number of bins you want to generate and click the **[!UICONTROL Initialize with]** link, as shown below:\n\n  ![](assets/reporting_descriptive_initialize.png)\n\n  Then adapt your content to suit your needs:\n\n  ![](assets/reporting_descriptive_initialize_perso.png)\n\n  Depending on the desired level of precision, fields containing dates can be grouped by time, day, month, year, etc.\n\n  ![](assets/reporting_descriptive_group_by_year.png)\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Modulo]** : lets you create groups of values in case of numerical values. For example, a modulo with a value of 10 lets you create an interval of values that change ten by ten.\n\n  ![](assets/reporting_descriptive_initialize_modulo.png)\n\n  This example lets you view the breakdown of recipients by age group.\n\n  ![](assets/reporting_descriptive_initialize_modulo_result.png)\n\n### Display data in the table {#displaying-data-in-the-table}\n\nUse the toolbar to personalize the display of variables in the table: delete a column, display data in lines rather than columns, move a column to the left or right, view or alter value calculation.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_report_wizard_toolbar.png)\n\nThe upper section of the window lets you select the display settings.\n\nYou can display or hide the name of the statistics and the sub-totals and choose the orientation of the statistics. For more on this, refer to [Analysis report display settings](../../reporting/using/processing-a-report.md#analysis-report-display-settings).\n\n### Display data in the chart {#displaying-data-in-the-chart}\n\nIn the first step of the descriptive analysis wizard, you can choose to display the data in chart form only, without a table. In this case, variable selection must be done when configuring the graphic. You must first select the number of variables to display and select the fields from the relevant database. \n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_report_wizard_023.png)\n\nThen select the desired chart type.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_report_wizard_024.png)\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>You can display the variables in a chart and a table at the same time. To do this, enter the variables in the **[!UICONTROL Table configuration]** window. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]** and select the type of chart in the chart configuration window. If sub-dimensions are defined in the table, they are not displayed in the chart.\n\nClick the **[!UICONTROL Variants]** link to modify the chart properties. \n\n![](assets/reporting_descriptive_graphe_options.png)\n\nThe options offered depend on the type of chart selected. For more information, refer to [this page](../../reporting/using/creating-a-chart.md#chart-types-and-variants).\n\n### Statistics calculation {#statistics-calculation}\n\nThe descriptive analysis wizard lets you calculate several types of statistics on the data. By default, only one simple count is configured.\n\nClick **[!UICONTROL Add]** to create a new statistic.\n\n![](assets/reporting_descriptive_create_stat.png)\n\nThe following operations are possible:\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Count]** to count all non-null values of the field to be aggregated, including duplicate values (of the aggregate field),\n* **[!UICONTROL Average]** to calculate the average of the values in a numerical field,\n* **[!UICONTROL Minimum]** to calculate the minimum of the values in a numerical field,\n* **[!UICONTROL Maximum]** to calculate the maximum of the values in a numerical field,\n* **[!UICONTROL Sum]** to calculate the sum of the values in a numerical field,\n* **[!UICONTROL Standard deviation]** to calculate how the returned values are scattered around the average,\n* **[!UICONTROL Row percentage distribution]** to calculate the ratio of the value in a column and the value in a row (available for tables only),\n* **[!UICONTROL Column percentage distribution]** to calculate the ratio of the value in a row to the value in a column (available for tables only),\n* **[!UICONTROL Total percentage distribution]** to calculate the distribution of recipients concerned by the values,\n\n  ![](assets/s_ncs_user_report_wizard_026.png)\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Calculated field]** to create a personalized operator (available for tables only). The **[!UICONTROL User function]** field lets you enter the calculation to be applied to the data.\n\n  Example: Calculating the average purchase amount per customer based on country and origin\n\n  ![](assets/report_compute_data_sample1.png)\n\n  To display the above information in a table, you need to create a calculated field for storing the average purchase amount per customer.\n\n  To do this:\n\n    1. Calculate the purchase total.\n    \n       ![](assets/report_compute_data_sample2.png)\n\n    1. This statistic won't be displayed in the table. You need to uncheck the **[!UICONTROL Display in the table]** option of the **[!UICONTROL Advanced]** tab. \n    \n       ![](assets/report_compute_data_sample3.png)\n\n    1. Create a new **[!UICONTROL Calculated field]** type statistic and enter the following formula in the **[!UICONTROL User function]** field: **@purchases/@count**.\n    \n       ![](assets/report_compute_data_sample4.png)\n\n### Display the report {#displaying-the-report}\n\nThe last step of the wizard lets you display the report, i.e. the table or the chart as they have been configured.\n\nWhen the report contains a table, the computation result cell is colored. The higher the result, the more intense the color.\n\n![](assets/report_compute_data_sample1.png)\n\nIt's possible to change the layout of results. To do this, right-click the concerned variable and select the input from the shortcut menu.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_report_wizard_029.png)\n\nWhen the report includes a chart, the labels of the legend let you filter the displayed information: click a label to enable/disable display in the chart.\n\n![](assets/report_display_data_in_graph.png)\n\n## Configure the quantitative distribution template {#configuring-the-quantitative-distribution-template}\n\nTo generate a descriptive analysis yourself, select the **New descriptive analysis from a template** option if it isn't set by default.\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL Quantitative distribution]** template that lets you generate statistics on data which can be measured or counted (e.g. invoice amount, age of recipients).\n\nThe configuration mode of an analysis report created via the **[!UICONTROL Quantitative distribution]** template is detailed in an implementation example [Quantitative data analysis](../../reporting/using/use-cases.md#quantitative-data-analysis).\n\nThe options available when using the descriptive analysis wizard to create a quantitative report are detailed below.\n\nStart by selecting the variable which the calculations concern:\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_report_wizard_017.png)\n\nBy default, Adobe Campaign offers a series of statistics to be calculated for the selected data. You can change this list, add to it or delete statistics depending on your needs.\n\nThe following operations are possible:\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Count]** to count all non-null values of the field to be aggregated, including duplicate values (of the aggregate field),\n* **[!UICONTROL Average]** to calculate the average of the values in a numerical field,\n* **[!UICONTROL Minimum]** to calculate the minimum of the values in a numerical field,\n* **[!UICONTROL Maximum]** to calculate the maximum of the values in a numerical field.\n* **[!UICONTROL Sum]** to calculate the sum of the values in a numerical field,\n* **[!UICONTROL Standard deviation]** to calculate how the values returned are distributed around the average.\n* **[!UICONTROL Number of missing values]** to calculate the number of numeric fields without defined values.\n* **[!UICONTROL Decile distribution]** to distribute the values returned such that each represents 1/10th of the values in a numeric field.\n* **[!UICONTROL Custom distribution]** to distribute the values returned based on user-defined thresholds.\n\n  The **[!UICONTROL Detail...]** button lets you edit a statistic and, if needed, personalize its calculation or its display:\n\n  ![](assets/s_ncs_user_report_wizard_030.png)\n\n  The last step of the wizard shows the quantitative analysis report.\n\n  ![](assets/reporting_descriptive_view_report.png)\n\n  To make changes to the report, refer to [Process a report](../../reporting/using/processing-a-report.md).\n","headers":[["title","Use the descriptive analysis wizard"],["description","Use the descriptive analysis wizard"],["feature","Reporting, Monitoring"]],"sections":[{"section":"Use the descriptive analysis wizard","sectionId":"6de0e964-2a98-4c4f-8650-a181c3eb5429","paragraphs":["To create a descriptive analysis report, use the dedicated wizard.
