In order to set up connections with external systems, you can create new external accounts.\n\nExternal accounts are used by technical processes such as technical workflows or campaign workflows. For example, when setting up a file transfer in a workflow or a data exchange with any other application (Adobe Target, Experience Manager, etc.), you need to select an external account.\n\n## Create an external account {#creating-an-external-account}\n\nTo create a new external account, follow the steps below. Detailed settings depend on the type of external account.\n\n1. From Campaign **[!UICONTROL Explorer]**, select **[!UICONTROL Administration]** '>' **[!UICONTROL Platform]** '>' **[!UICONTROL External accounts]**.\n\n   ![](assets/ext_account_1.png)\n\n1. Click the **[!UICONTROL New]** button.\n\n   ![](assets/ext_account_2.png)\n\n1. Enter a **[!UICONTROL Label]** and an **[!UICONTROL Internal Name]**. \n1. Select your external account **[!UICONTROL Type]** which one you want to create.\n1. Configure the access to the account by specifying credentials depending on the chosen external account type.\n\n   The necessary information is usually provided by the provider of the server you are connecting to.\n\n1. Check the **[!UICONTROL Enabled]** option to activate the connection.\n1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.\n\nThe external account is created and added to the external accounts list. \n\n## Campaign-specific External Accounts\n\n### Bounce mails {#bounce-mails-external-account}\n\nThe **Bounce mails** external account specifies the external POP3 account to be used to connect to the email service. For more on this external account, refer to this [page](../../workflow/using/inbound-emails.md).\n\nAll servers configured for POP3 access can be used to receive return mail.\n\n![](assets/ext_account_6.png)\n\nTo configure the **[!UICONTROL Bounce mails (defaultPopAccount)]** external account:\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Server]**\n\n  URL of the POP3 server.\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Port]**\n\n  POP3 connection port number. The default port is 110.\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Account]**\n\n  Name of the user.\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Password]**\n\n  User account password.\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Encryption]**\n\n  Type of chosen encryption between **[!UICONTROL By default]**, **[!UICONTROL POP3 + STARTTLS]**, **[!UICONTROL POP3]** or **[!UICONTROL POP3S]**.\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Function]**\n\n  Inbound email or SOAP router\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n>\n>Before configuring your POP3 external account using Microsoft OAuth 2.0, you first need to register your application in the Azure portal. For more on this, refer to [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).\n\nTo configure a POP3 external using **Microsoft OAuth 2.0**, check the **[!UICONTROL Microsoft OAuth 2.0]** option and fill in the following fields:\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Azure tenant]**\n\n  Azure ID (or Directory (tenant) ID) can be found in the **Essentials** drop-down of your application overview in the Azure portal.\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Azure Client ID]**\n\n  Client ID (or Application (client) ID) can be found in the **Essentials** drop-down of your application overview in the Azure portal.\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Azure Client secret]**\n\n  Client secret ID can be found in the **Client secrets** column from the **Certificates & secrets** menu of your application in the Azure portal.\n\n* **[!UICONTROL Azure Redirect URL]**\n\n  Redirect URL can be found in the **Authentication** menu of your application in the Azure portal. It should end with the following syntax `nl/jsp/oauth.jsp`, e.g. `https://redirect.adobe.net/nl/jsp/oauth.jsp`.\n\nAfter entering your different credentials, you can click **[!UICONTROL Setup the connection]** to finish your external account configuration.\n\n### Routing{#routing-external-account}\n\nThe **[!UICONTROL Routing]** external account allows you to configure each channel available in Adobe Campaign depending on the packages installed.\n\n![](assets/ext_account_7.png)\n\nThe following channels can be configured:\n\n* [Email](#email-routing-external-account)\n* [Mobile (SMS)](../../delivery/using/sms-set-up.md#creating-an-smpp-external-account)\n* [Phone](../../delivery/using/communication-channels.md#other-channels)\n* [Direct mail](../../delivery/using/about-direct-mail-channel.md)\n* [Agency](../../delivery/using/communication-channels.md#other-channels)\n* [X (formerly known as Twitter)](../../social/using/about-social-marketing.md)\n* [iOS channel](../../delivery/using/configuring-the-mobile-application.md)\n* [Android channel](../../delivery/using/configuring-the-mobile-application-android.md)\n\n### Email routing {#email-routing-external-account}\n\nThe email routing external account is provided by default, adapted to your configuration. \n\nAs an on-premise/hybrid customer, you can create new routing external accounts, or update parameters, as described below.
