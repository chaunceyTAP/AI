Some web pages may stop displaying correctly in the these new browser versions.\n\nThe compatibility of major websites has been tested ahead of time. If there are issues with sites that cannot be fixed before these versions are released, companies have backup plans ready to ensure the sites are not affected.\n\nPotential problems or loss of functionality on web site originate from the user agent string that browsers send to websites you are visiting: the user agent is a string sent by the browser to the website to let the site know which browser and version you are using, and associated technology. When your browser sends a request to a website, it identifies itself with the user agent string before it retrieves the content you requested. The data in the user agent string help the website to deliver the content in a format that suits your browser. The version of the user agent is incremented to match the browser version number. Moving from 2 to 3-digits can cause issues.\n\n## Are you impacted?{#version-100-impact}\n\nAdobe recommends you to test your Campaign web applications, including web forms and surveys, to make sure they will still work fine with these new browser versions. \n\nThis recommendation applies to all web applications, and especially if you have included JavaScript code. \n\nYou must check with all browsers, mobile and desktop.\n\n## How to test?{#version-100-test}\n\nYou can configure your browsers to report the version as 100 right now, then report and correct any issues you come across.\n\nWith these settings, the browser sends the new user agent string to websites, indicating that the browser is v100. If you run into any issues with your web forms, you should create a bug for the browser editor. Consider rebuilding these web forms before these updates are broadly available.\n\n### Test with Firefox 100{#test-firefox-100}\n\nTo test your web pages with Mozilla Firefox 100, you can simulate the upcoming user agent change on your web apps by manually changing your user agent string.\n\n1.
