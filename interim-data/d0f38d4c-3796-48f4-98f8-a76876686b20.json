For example, between a recipient and a current order. A recipient can be related to only one occurrence of the current order table at a time. \n* ![](assets/externaljoin11.png) : Cardinality 1-1, external join. For example, between a recipient and their country. A recipient can be related to only one occurrence of the table country. The content of the country table will not be saved. \n* ![](assets/join_with_campaign1n.png) : Cardinality 1-N. For example, between a recipient and the subscriptions table. A recipient can be related to several occurrences on the subscriptions table.\n\nFor join relations using Federated Database Access (FDA):\n\n* ![](assets/join_fda_11.png) : Cardinality 1-1\n* ![](assets/join_fda_1m.png) : Cardinality 1-N\n\nFor more information on FDA tables, refer to [Accessing an external database](../../installation/using/about-fda.md).\n\nA link must be declared in the schema containing the foreign key of the table linked via the main element:\n\n```sql\n<element name=\"name_of_link\" type=\"link\" target=\"key_of_destination_schema\">\n  <join xpath-dst=\"xpath_of_field1_destination_table\" xpath-src=\"xpath_of_field1_source_table\"/>\n  <join xpath-dst=\"xpath_of_field2_destination_table\" xpath-src=\"xpath_of_field2_source_table\"/>\n  ...\n</element>\n```\n\nLinks obey the following rules:\n\n* The definition of a link is entered on a **link**-type **`<element>`** with the following attributes:\n\n    * **name**: name of link from the source table\n    * **target**: name of target schema\n    * **label**: label of link\n    * **revLink** (optional): name of reverse link from the target schema (deduced automatically by default)\n    * **integrity** (optional): referential integrity of the occurrence of the source table to the occurrence of the target table. \n        Possible values are:\n\n        * **define**: it is possible to delete the source occurrence if it is no longer referenced by a target occurrence\n        * **normal**: deleting the source occurrence initializes the keys of the link to the target occurrence (default mode), this type of integrity initializes all foreign keys\n        * **own**: deleting the source occurrence leads to the deletion of the target occurrence\n        * **owncopy**: the same as **own** (in case of deletion) or duplicates the occurrences (in case of duplication)\n        * **neutral**: no specific behavior\n\n    * **revIntegrity** (optional): integrity on the target schema (optional, \"normal\" by default)\n    * **revCardinality** (optional): with value \"single\" populates cardinality with type 1-1 (1-N by default)\n    * **externalJoin** (optional): forces the outer join\n    * **revExternalJoin** (optional): forces the outer join on the reverse link\n\n* A link references one or more fields from the source table to the destination table. The fields making up the join ( `<join>`  element) need not be populated because they are automatically deduced by default using the internal key of the target schema.\n* An index is automatically added to the foreign key of the link in the extended schema.\n* A link consists of two half-links, where the first is declared from the source schema and the second is created automatically in the extended schema of the target schema.\n* A join can be an outer join if the **externalJoin** attribute is added, with the value \"true\" (supported in PostgreSQL).\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>As a standard, links are the elements declared at the end of the schema.\n\n## Example: reverse link {#example-1}\n\nIn the example below, we declare a 1-N relation to the \"cus:company\" schema table:\n\n```sql\n<srcSchema name=\"recipient\" namespace=\"cus\">\n  <element name=\"recipient\">\n    ...\n    <element label=\"Company\" name=\"company\" revIntegrity=\"define\" revLabel=\"Contact\" target=\"cus:company\" type=\"link\"/>\n  </element>\n</srcSchema>\n```\n\nThe schema generated:\n\n```sql\n<schema mappingType=\"sql\" name=\"recipient\" namespace=\"cus\" xtkschema=\"xtk:schema\">  \n  <element name=\"recipient\" sqltable=\"CusRecipient\"> \n    <dbindex name=\"companyId\">      \n      <keyfield xpath=\"@company-id\"/>    \n    </dbindex>\n    ...\n    <element label=\"Company\" name=\"company\" revLink=\"recipient\" target=\"cus:company\" type=\"link\">      \n      <join xpath-dst=\"@id\" xpath-src=\"@company-id\"/>    \n    </element>    \n    <attribute advanced=\"true\" label=\"Foreign key of 'Company' link (field 'id')\" name=\"company-id\" sqlname=\"iCompanyId\" type=\"long\"/>\n  </element>\n</schema>\n```\n\nThe link definition is supplemented by the fields making up the join, i.e. the primary key with its XPath (\"@id\") in the destination schema, and the foreign key with its XPath (\"@company-id\") in the schema.\n\nThe foreign key is added automatically in an element that uses the same characteristics as the associated field in the destination table, with the following naming convention: name of target schema followed by name of associated field (\"company-id\" in our example).\n\nExtended schema of the target (\"cus:company\"):\n\n```sql\n<schema mappingType=\"sql\" name=\"company\" namespace=\"cus\" xtkschema=\"xtk:schema\">  \n  <element name=\"company\" sqltable=\"CusCompany\" autopk=\"true\"> \n    <dbindex name=\"id\" unique=\"true\">     \n      <keyfield xpath=\"@id\"/>    \n    </dbindex>   \n    <key internal=\"true\" name=\"id\">      \n      <keyfield xpath=\"@id\"/>    \n    </key>\n    ...\n    <attribute desc=\"Internal primary key\" label=\"Primary key\" name=\"id\" sqlname=\"iCompanyId\" type=\"long\"/>\n    ...\n    <element belongsTo=\"cus:recipient\" integrity=\"define\" label=\"Contact\" name=\"recipient\" revLink=\"company\" target=\"nms:recipient\" type=\"link\" unbound=\"true\">      \n      <join xpath-dst=\"@company-id\" xpath-src=\"@id\"/>    \n    </element>\n  </element>\n</schema>\n```\n\nA reverse link to the \"cus:recipient\" table was added with the following parameters:\n\n* **name**: automatically deduced from the name of the source schema (can be forced with the \"revLink\" attribute in the link definition on the source schema)\n* **revLink**: name of reverse link\n* **target**: key of linked schema (\"cus:recipient\" schema)\n* **unbound**: the link is declared as a collection element for a 1-N cardinality (by default)\n* **integrity**: \"define\" by default (can be forced with the \"revIntegrity\" attribute in the link definition on the source schema).\n\n## Example: simple link {#example-2}\n\nIn this example, we declare a link towards the \"nms:address\" schema table. The join is an outer join and is populated explicitly with the recipient's email address and the \"@address\" field of the linked table (\"nms:address\").\n\n```sql\n<srcSchema name=\"recipient\" namespace=\"cus\">\n  <element name=\"recipient\"> \n    ...\n    <element integrity=\"neutral\" label=\"Info about email\" name=\"emailInfo\" revIntegrity=\"neutral\" revLink=\"recipient\" target=\"nms:address\" type=\"link\" externalJoin=\"true\">      \n      <join xpath-dst=\"@address\" xpath-src=\"@email\"/>\n    </element>\n  </element>\n</srcSchema>\n```\n\n## Example: unique cardinality {#example-3}\n\nIn this example, we create a 1-1 relation to the \"cus:extension\" schema table:\n\n```sql\n<element integrity=\"own\" label=\"Extension\" name=\"extension\" revCardinality=\"single\" revLink=\"recipient\" target=\"cus:extension\" type=\"link\"/>\n```\n\n## Example: link to a folder {#example-4}\n\nIn this example, we declare a link to a folder (\"xtk:folder\" schema):\n\n```sql\n<element default=\"DefaultFolder('nmsFolder')\" label=\"Folder\" name=\"folder\" revDesc=\"Recipients in the folder\" revIntegrity=\"own\" revLabel=\"Recipients\" target=\"xtk:folder\" type=\"link\"/>\n```\n\nThe default value returns the identifier of the first eligible parameter type file entered in the \"DefaultFolder('nmsFolder')\" function.\n\n## Example: create a key on a link {#example-5}\n\nIn this example, we create a key on a link (\"company\" to \"cus:company\" schema) with the **xlink** attribute and a field of the (\"email\") table:\n\n```sql\n<srcSchema name=\"recipient\" namespace=\"cus\">\n  <element name=\"recipient\">\n    <key name=\"companyEmail\"> \n      <keyfield xpath=\"@email\"/>\n      <keyfield xlink=\"company\"/>\n    </key>\n    \n    <attribute name=\"email\" type=\"string\" length=\"80\" label=\"Email\" desc=\"Recipient email\"/>\n    <element label=\"Company\" name=\"company\" revIntegrity=\"define\" revLabel=\"Contact\" target=\"cus:company\" type=\"link\"/>\n  </element>\n</srcSchema>\n```\n\nThe schema generated:\n\n```sql\n<schema mappingType=\"sql\" name=\"recipient\" namespace=\"cus\" xtkschema=\"xtk:schema\">  \n  <element name=\"recipient\" sqltable=\"CusRecipient\"> \n    <dbindex name=\"companyId\">      \n      <keyfield xpath=\"@company-id\"/>    \n    </dbindex>\n\n    <dbindex name=\"companyEmail\" unique=\"true\">\n      <keyfield xpath=\"@email\"/>      \n      <keyfield xpath=\"@company-id\"/>    \n    </dbindex>    \n\n    <key name=\"companyEmail\">      \n      <keyfield xpath=\"@email\"/>      \n      <keyfield xpath=\"@company-id\"/>    \n    </key>\n\n    <attribute desc=\"Email address of recipient\" label=\"Email\" length=\"80\" name=\"email\" sqlname=\"sEmail\" type=\"string\"/>\n    <element label=\"Company\" name=\"company\" revLink=\"recipient\" target=\"sfa:company\" type=\"link\">      \n      <join xpath-dst=\"@id\" xpath-src=\"@company-id\"/>    \n    </element>    \n    <attribute advanced=\"true\" label=\"Foreign key of link 'Company' (field 'id')\" name=\"company-id\" sqlname=\"iCompanyId\" type=\"long\"/>\n  </element>\n</schema>\n```\n\nThe definition of the \"companyEmail\" name key was extended with the foreign key of the \"company\" link.
