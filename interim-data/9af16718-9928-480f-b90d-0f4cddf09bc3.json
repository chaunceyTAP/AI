This is achieved with new adaptive delivery techniques that alter email sending settings in real-time based on feedback from Internet Service Providers.\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n>\n>The Adobe Campaign Enhanced MTA is only available for Campaign Classic hosted or hybrid customers. Campaign Classic on-premise installations cannot be upgraded to use the Enhanced MTA.\n\nIf you were provisioned a Campaign Classic instance after September 2018, you are using the Enhanced MTA. For all other Campaign Classic customers, see the [Frequently asked questions](#enhanced-mta-faq) below.\n\nThe Enhanced MTA implementation may impact some of the existing Campaign functionality. For more on this, see the [Enhanced MTA specificities](#enhanced-mta-impacts).\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>If you are an end user of Adobe Campaign and you want to know whether your instance has been upgraded to the Enhanced MTA, contact your internal Campaign administrator.\n\n## Frequently asked questions {#enhanced-mta-faq}\n\n### Usage and benefits\n\n**What is the Enhanced MTA?**\n\nAdobe Campaign can now be upgraded to use a new MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) which runs SparkPost's commercial email MTA called **Momentum**.\n\nMomentum represents innovative, high-performance MTA technology which includes smarter bounce handling and an automated deliverability optimization capability that helps senders achieve and maintain optimal inbox delivery rates. <!--More than 37% of the world's business email is sent using SparkPost's MTA technology.-->\n\n**What are the benefits?**\n\n* Adobe Campaign clients using the Enhanced MTA have seen a <!--300%-->massive increase in overall throughput speed, and a <!--90%+-->significant reduction in soft bounces.\n* The Enhanced MTA uses the latest MTA technology to provide you with the optimal throughput speeds for your email delivery.\n* By adapting instantly and automatically to the feedback it receives, it also ensures more accurate and intelligent email delivery with real-time delivery data.\n\n**Can I use the native Adobe Campaign MTA and the Enhanced MTA at the same time?**\n\nNo. Only the Enhanced MTA can be used for your email deliveries after your instance has been upgraded.\n\n<!--\n**Is there a fee associated with upgrading my instance to and subsequent use of the Enhanced MTA?**\nNo, there is no extra fee associated with the upgrade process to enable the use of the Enhanced MTA.\n\n**When will the Enhanced MTA be available to me?**\n\n* If you are new to Adobe Campaign Classic, you are already using the Enhanced MTA.\n\n* For Adobe Campaign Classic existing customers, we've implemented a phased rollout that covers all hosted or partially hosted (hybrid) instances. If you're not already using it, we'll be contacting you in the near future with the dates and details for upgrading your Adobe Campaign Classic instances to the Enhanced MTA.\n-->\n\n### Upgrading to the enhanced MTA\n\n**What is required to upgrade to the Enhanced MTA?**\n\nIf you were provisioned a Campaign Classic instance after September 2018, no action is required as you are already using the Enhanced MTA.\n\nFor all other hosted or partially hosted (hybrid) customers, the Adobe Campaign team will reach out to coordinate a date for migration and will provide details on the appropriate steps needed to migrate.\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n>\n>The Enhanced MTA is not available for on-premise installations.\n\n**What is the process to upgrade my instance to the Enhanced MTA?**\n\nThe entire process for your hosted instances requires a few minutes of downtime. Adobe will monitor the email throughput and deliverability for up to 24 hours post-upgrade to assess any impact to your email deliveries.\n\nIn case any issues are discovered, Adobe can quickly and temporarily revert your instance back to the native Adobe Campaign MTA.\n\nCurrently, the Enhanced MTA only affects the email channel. Your push notifications and SMS deliveries will continue to use the native Campaign MTA and will not be affected in any way by the upgrade.\n\n**Do I need to go through IP warming again after upgrading to the Enhanced MTA?**\n\nNo. Upgrading does not require switching to new IPs, so you can continue using your existing, warmed email IPs.\n\n**Will upgrading to the Enhanced MTA impact any campaigns or deliveries currently in progress?**\n\nFor customers using Adobe Campaign transactional messaging functionality, any API calls to trigger an email will be queued during the very short upgrade downtime and will be attempted upon completion of the upgrade.\n\n## Enhanced MTA specificities {#enhanced-mta-impacts}\n\n### New MX rules\n\nThe MX management delivery throughput rules are no longer used. The Enhanced MTA has its own MX rules that allow it to customize your throughput by domain based on your own historical email reputation, and on the real-time feedback coming from the domains where you're sending emails.\n\nFor more on MX configuration, see [this section](../../installation/using/email-deliverability.md#mx-configuration).\n\n### Bounce qualification\n\nThe bounce qualifications in the Campaign **[!UICONTROL Delivery log qualification]** table are no longer used for **synchronous** delivery failure error messages. The Enhanced MTA determines the bounce type and qualification, and sends back that information to Campaign.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>The Enhanced MTA qualifies the SMTP bounce and sends that qualification back to Campaign in the form of a bounce code mapped to a Campaign bounce reason and qualification.\n\nFor more on bounce qualification, see [this section](understanding-delivery-failures.md#bounce-mail-qualification).\n\n### Delivery\n\nA delivery cannot be stopped once it has been transferred to the Enhanced MTA - even though it is displayed with the **[!UICONTROL Stopped]** status in Campaign.\n\n### Delivery throughput\n\nThe Campaign Delivery throughput graph will no longer display the throughput to your email recipients. That graph will now show the throughput speed for the relay of your messages from Campaign over to the Enhanced MTA.\n\nFor more on the delivery throughput, see [this section](../../reporting/using/global-reports.md#delivery-throughput).\n\n### Retries\n\nThe retry settings in the delivery are no longer used by Campaign. Soft bounce retries and the length of time between them are determined by the Enhanced MTA based on the type and severity of the bounce responses coming back from the message's email domain.\n\nFor more on retries, see [this section](steps-sending-the-delivery.md#configuring-retries).\n\n### Validity period\n\nThe validity period setting in your Campaign deliveries will be used by the Enhanced MTA only if set to **3.5 days or less**. If you define a value higher than 3.5 days in Campaign, it will not be taken into account.\n\nFor example, if the validity period is set to the default value of 5 days in Campaign, soft-bouncing messages will go into the Enhanced MTA retry queue and be retried for only up to 3.5 days from when that message reached the Enhanced MTA. In that case, the value set in Campaign will not be used.\n\nOnce a message has been in the Enhanced MTA queue for 3.5 days and has failed to deliver, it will time out and its status will be updated from **[!UICONTROL Sent]** to **[!UICONTROL Failed]** in the delivery logs.\n\nFor more on the validity period, see [this section](steps-sending-the-delivery.md#defining-validity-period).\n\n### DKIM-signing\n\nDKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) email authentication signing is done by the Enhanced MTA. DKIM-signing by the native Campaign MTA will be turned off within the Domain management table as part of the Enhanced MTA upgrade.\nFor more on DKIM, see the [Adobe Deliverability Best Practice Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/deliverability-learn/deliverability-best-practice-guide/transition-process/infrastructure.html#authentication).\n\n### Delivery success reporting\n\nIn the **[!UICONTROL Summary]** view of an email delivery [dashboard](delivery-dashboard.md), the **[!UICONTROL Success]** percentage starts out at 100% and then progressively goes down throughout the delivery [validity period](steps-sending-the-delivery.md#defining-validity-period), as the soft and hard bounces get reported back from the Enhanced MTA to Campaign.\n\nIndeed, all messages show as **[!UICONTROL Sent]** in the [sending logs](delivery-dashboard.md#delivery-logs-and-history) as soon as they are successfully relayed from Campaign to the Enhanced MTA. They remain in that status unless or until a [bounce](understanding-delivery-failures.md#delivery-failure-types-and-reasons) for that message is communicated back from the Enhanced MTA to Campaign.\n\nWhen hard-bouncing messages get reported back from the Enhanced MTA, their status changes from **[!UICONTROL Sent]** to **[!UICONTROL Failed]** and the **[!UICONTROL Success]** percentage is decreased accordingly.\n\nWhen soft-bouncing messages get reported back from the Enhanced MTA, they still show as **[!UICONTROL Sent]** and the **[!UICONTROL Success]** percentage is not yet updated. Soft-bouncing messages are then [retried](understanding-delivery-failures.md#retries-after-a-delivery-temporary-failure) throughout the delivery validity period:\n\n* If a retry is successful before the end of the validity period, the message status remains as **[!UICONTROL Sent]** and the **[!UICONTROL Success]** percentage remains unchanged.\n\n* Otherwise, the status changes to **[!UICONTROL Failed]** and the **[!UICONTROL Success]** percentage is decreased accordingly.\n\nConsequently, you should wait until the end of the validity period to see the final **[!UICONTROL Success]** percentage, and the final number of actually **[!UICONTROL Sent]** and **[!UICONTROL Failed]** messages.\n\nThe table below shows the different steps in the sending process with the corresponding KPIs and sending logs statuses.\n\n| Step in the sending process | KPI summary | Sending logs status | \n|--- |--- |--- |\n| Message is successfully relayed from Campaign to the Enhanced MTA | **[!UICONTROL Success]** percentage starts out at 100%| Sent |\n| Hard-bouncing messages get reported back from the Enhanced MTA | **[!UICONTROL Success]** percentage is decreased accordingly | Failed |\n| Soft-bouncing messages get reported back from the Enhanced MTA | No change in **[!UICONTROL Success]** percentage | Sent |\n| Soft-bouncing messages retries are successful | No change in **[!UICONTROL Success]** percentage | Sent | **[!UICONTROL Success]** percentage is increased accordingly | Sent |\n| Soft-bouncing messages retries fail | **[!UICONTROL Success]** percentage is decreased accordingly | Failed |\n\n","headers":[["title","Send with the Enhanced MTA in Adobe Campaign Classic"],["description","Learn about the scope and the specificities of sending emails with the Adobe Campaign Enhanced MTA"],["feature","Email"]],"sections":[{"section":"Sending with the Enhanced MTA","sectionId":"99095f72-815e-411c-ad36-7343ad30cf75","paragraphs":["The Adobe Campaign Enhanced MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) provides an upgraded sending infrastructure allowing for improved deliverability, reputation, throughput, reporting, bounce handling, IP ramp up and connection setting management.","It is implemented to improve scalability, increase delivery throughput and help send more emails faster.
