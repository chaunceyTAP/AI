Follow the steps below to configure access to [!DNL Microsoft SQL Server].\n\n1. Configure [!DNL Microsoft SQL Server] on [CentOS](#sql-centos).\n1. Configure [!DNL Microsoft SQL Server] on [Linux](#sql-linux).\n1. Configure [!DNL Microsoft SQL Server] on [Windows](#sql-windows).\n1. Configure the [!DNL Microsoft SQL Server] [external account](#sql-external) in Campaign\n\n## Microsoft SQL Server on CentOS {#sql-centos}\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n> [!DNL Microsoft SQL Server] is available on CentOS 7 and 6.\n\nTo configure [!DNL Microsoft SQL Server] on CentOS, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Download and install SQL ODBC driver with the following command:\n\n    ``` \n    sudo su\n    curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/7/prod.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/mssql-release.repo\n    exit\n    sudo yum remove unixODBC-utf16 unixODBC-utf16-devel #to avoid conflicts\n    sudo ACCEPT_EULA=Y yum install msodbcsql\n    ``` \n\n1. In Adobe Campaign, you can then configure your [!DNL Microsoft SQL Server] external account. For more on how to configure your external account, refer to [this section](#sql-external).\n\n## Microsoft SQL Server on Linux {#sql-linux}\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n> If you are running an older version of Adobe Campaign (prior to 7.2.1), you need to install `unix ODBC drivers`.\n\n1. Download the MS ODBC driver from [this page](https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/16.04/prod/pool/main/m/msodbcsql17/).\n\n1. Run the following command as root user:\n\n    ``` \n    # install the mssql odbc that was downloaded\n    dpkg -i msodbcsql17_17.7.1.1-1_amd64.deb\n    # accept the license terms\n    ``` \n\n1. In Adobe Campaign, you can then configure your [!DNL Microsoft SQL Server] external account. For more on how to configure your external account, refer to [this section](#sql-external).\n\n## Microsoft SQL Server on Windows {#sql-windows}\n\nTo configure [!DNL Microsoft SQL Server] on Windows:\n\n1. In Windows, click **[!UICONTROL Control Panel]** '>' **[!UICONTROL System and Security]** '>' **[!UICONTROL Administrative Tools]**'>' **[!UICONTROL ODBC Data Sources (64-bit)]**.\n\n1. From the **[!UICONTROL ODBC Data Sources (64-bit)]** new window, click **[!UICONTROL Add...]**.\n\n1. Check if SQL Server Native Client v11 is listed in the **[!UICONTROL Create New Data Source]** window.\n\n1. If the SQL Server Native Client is not listed, you can download it in [this page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-my/download/details.aspx?id=36434).\n\n1. In Adobe Campaign, you can then configure your [!DNL Microsoft SQL Server] external account. For more on how to configure your external account, refer to [this section](#sql-external).\n\n## Microsoft SQL Server external account {#sql-external}\n\nYou need to create a [!DNL Microsoft SQL Server] external account to connect your Campaign instance to your [!DNL Microsoft SQL Server] external database.\n\n1. From Campaign **[!UICONTROL Explorer]**, click **[!UICONTROL Administration]** '>' **[!UICONTROL Platform]** '>' **[!UICONTROL External accounts]**.\n\n1. Click **[!UICONTROL New]**.\n\n1. Select **[!UICONTROL External database]** as your external account's **[!UICONTROL Type]**.\n\n1. Under **[!UICONTROL Configuration]**, select [!DNL Microsoft SQL Server] from the **[!UICONTROL Type]** drop-down.\n\n    ![](assets/sql.png)\n\n1. Configure the **[!UICONTROL Microsoft SQL Server]** external account authentication:\n\n    * **[!UICONTROL Server]**: URL of the [!DNL Microsoft SQL Server] server.\n\n    * **[!UICONTROL Account]**: Name of the user.\n\n    * **[!UICONTROL Password]**: User account password.\n\n    * **[!UICONTROL Database]**: Name of the database (optional).\n\n    * **[!UICONTROL Timezone]**: Timezone set in [!DNL Microsoft SQL Server]. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/current-timezone-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15)\n\n1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Parameters]** tab then the **[!UICONTROL Deploy functions]** button to create functions.\n\n    >[!NOTE]\n    >\n    >For all functions to be available, you need to create the Adobe Campaign SQL functions in the remote database. For more information, refer to this [page](../../configuration/using/adding-additional-sql-functions.md).\n\n1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** when your configuration is finished.\n\nThe connector supports the following options:\n\n| Option   |  Description |\n|---|---|\n|  Authentication | Type of authentication supported by the connector. Current supported value: ActiveDirectoryMSI. <br> For more on this, refer to example 8 of [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/using-azure-active-directory?view=sql-server-ver15#example-connection-strings).|\n|  Encrypt |  Specifies whether connections use the TLS encryption over the network. Possible values are **yes/mandatory (18.0 and later)**, **no/optional (18.0 and later)**, and **strict (18.0 and later)**. The default value is set to **yes** in version 18.0 and later and **no** in previous versions. <br>For more on this, refer to [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/dsn-connection-string-attribute?view=azure-sqldw-latest#encrypt). |\n|  TrustServerCertificate | Enables encryption using a self-signed server certificate, when used with **Encrypt**. <br>Accepted values: **yes** or **no** (default value, which means that the server certificate will be validated).|\n",
