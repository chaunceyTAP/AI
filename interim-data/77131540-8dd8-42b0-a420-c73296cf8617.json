This workflow carries out the following tasks:\n\n* deletion of expired records,\n* deletion of orphaned records and status reinitialization for expired objects,\n* updating the database statistics.\n\n>[!IMPORTANT]\n>\n>Please note that the cleanup task deals mostly with application level maintenance, not with RDBMS level maintenance (with the exception of statistics update). However, maintenance operations will be required on the database. Even if the database cleanup workflow runs successfully, this does not mean that the database is optimally tuned.\n\n## Technical maintenance {#technical-maintenance}\n\nThe database cleanup workflow does not include any database maintenance tool: it is up to you to organize maintenance. To do this, you can either:\n\n* work with your Database Administrator to set up database maintenance with third-party tools,\n* use the Adobe Campaign workflow engine to schedule and track these maintenance activities.\n\nThese maintenance procedures must be carried out on a regular basis and should include the following:\n\n* re-index frequently updated tables,\n* compact/rebuild the tables to avoid fragmentation.\n\n### Maintenance schedule {#maintenance-schedule}\n\nYou need to find the appropriate slots for performing these maintenance activities. They can heavily impact the database performance while running or even block the application (due to locking).\n\nThese tasks are typically run once a week during a period of low activity that does not collide with backups, data reloading or aggregate calculation. Some systems which are highly solicited require more frequent maintenance.\n\nMore in-depth maintenance, such as full table rebuilds, can be performed once a month, preferably with applications fully stopped since the system is unusable anyway.\n\n### Rebuilding a table {#rebuilding-a-table}\n\nSeveral strategies are available:\n\n<table> \n <thead> \n  <tr> \n   <th> Operations </th> \n   <th> Description </th> \n   <th> Benefits </th> \n   <th> Drawbacks </th> \n  </tr> \n </thead> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td> Online defragmentation<br /> </td> \n   <td> Most database engines provide defragmentation methods.<br /> </td> \n   <td> Simply use the database defragmentation method.
