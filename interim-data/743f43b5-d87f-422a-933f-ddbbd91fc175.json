If you haven't already defined a connection between Adobe Campaign and the (S)FTP server hosting the content files, create a new S3, FTP or SFTP external account in **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Platform]** > **[!UICONTROL External Accounts]**. Specify in this external account the address and credentials used to establish the connection to the S3 or (S)FTP server.\n\n   Here is an example of an S3 external account:\n\n   ![](assets/delivery_loadcontent_filetransfertexamples3.png)\n\n1. Create a new workflow, for example from **[!UICONTROL Profiles and Targets]** > **[!UICONTROL Jobs]** > **[!UICONTROL Targeting workflows]**.\n1. Add a **[!UICONTROL File transfer]** activity into your workflow, and configure it by specifying\n\n    * The external account to use to connect to the S3 or (S)FTP server.\n    * The path of the file on the S3 or (S)FTP server.\n\n   ![](assets/delivery_loadcontent_filetransfertexample.png)\n\n1. Add a **[!UICONTROL Delivery]** activity and connect it to the outbound transition of the **[!UICONTROL File transfer]** activity. Configure it as follows:\n\n    * Delivery: According to your needs, it can be a specific delivery that is already created in the system, or a new delivery based on an existing template.\n    * Recipients: In this example, it is considered that the target is specified in the delivery itself.\n    * Content: Even if the content is imported in the previous activity, select **[!UICONTROL Specified in the delivery]**. As the content is imported directly from a file located on a remote server, it has no identifier when processed by the workflow and cannot be identified as coming from the inbound event.\n    * Action to perform: Select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save the delivery and be able to access it from **[!UICONTROL Campaign management]** > **[!UICONTROL Deliveries]** once the workflow is executed.\n\n   ![](assets/delivery_loadcontent_activityexample.png)\n\n1. In the **[!UICONTROL Script]** tab of the **[!UICONTROL Delivery]** activity, add the following command to load the content of the imported file in the delivery:\n\n   ```\n   delivery.content.html.source=loadFile(vars.filename)\n   ```\n\n   ![](assets/delivery_loadcontent_script.png)\n\n1. Save and execute the workflow. A new delivery with the loaded content is created under **[!UICONTROL Campaign management]** > **[!UICONTROL Deliveries]**.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>Best practices and troubleshooting on SFTP server usage are detailed [in this page](../../platform/using/sftp-server-usage.md).\n","headers":[["title","Load delivery content"],["description","Loading delivery content"],["feature","Workflows"]],"sections":[{"section":"Load delivery content","sectionId":"1ba655ac-3463-4539-8183-6ba1d0bb5d6d","paragraphs":["If your delivery content is available in an HTML file located on Amazon S3, FTP or SFTP servers, you can easily load this content into Adobe Campaign deliveries.","To do this:","If you haven't already defined a connection between Adobe Campaign and the (S)FTP server hosting the content files, create a new S3, FTP or SFTP external account in Administration > Platform > External Accounts.
