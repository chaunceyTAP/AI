To do this, include the link to the mirror page in the delivery.\n\n## Social networks: sharing a link {#social-networks--sharing-a-link}\n\nTo enable delivery recipients to share the content of messages with members of their network, you need to include the matching personalization block.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_user_viral_add_link.png)\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>By default, this link is not offered in the list of blocks.

This lets the members of their network access the communication.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>This personalization block contains all links (for message sending and sharing with all social networks). It can be altered to meet your needs. However, configuration is reserved for advanced users. To edit the matching personalization block, go to the **[!UICONTROL Resources > Campaign management > Personalization blocks]** node of the Adobe Campaign tree.\n\n## Viral marketing: forward to a friend {#viral-marketing--forward-to-a-friend}\n\nA viral service allows referral-type actions to be carried out: these actions enable you to forward a message to a friend. The profile of the referee(s) is stored temporarily in the database (in a dedicated table). Forwarded messages include a link for the referee to subscribe: if they do, they will be added to the Adobe Campaign database.\n\nMessage forwarding is based on the same principles as social network links.\n\nApply the following stages:\n\n1. Add the **[!UICONTROL Social network sharing links]** personalization block into the body of the original message.\n1. The message recipient can click the **[!UICONTROL Email]** icon to send this message to one or more friends. \n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_user_viral_email_link.png)\n\n   A referral form enables you to enter the email addresses of referees. \n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_user_viral_email_msg.png)\n\n   The message is sent to them when the main recipient clicks the **[!UICONTROL Next]** button.\n\n   >[!NOTE]\n   >\n   >The content of this message can be personalized to meet your needs.

An entry form is provided for this purpose. \n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_user_viral_create_account_form.png)\n\n   >[!NOTE]\n   >\n   >This configuration can be adapted.
