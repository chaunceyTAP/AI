Configure the following elements:\n\n* a filter on the folder (refer to [Adding a filter on a folder](#adding-a-filter-on-a-folder)),\n* a button for creating a new Web application (refer to [Adding a button to configure a new Web application](#adding-a-button-to-configure-a-new-web-application)),\n* detail display for each entry in the list (refer to [Adding detail to a list](#adding-detail-to-a-list)),\n* one filter per link editing tool (refer to [Creating a filter using a link editor](#creating-a-filter-using-a-link-editor)), \n* a refresh link (refer to [Creating a refresh link](#creating-a-refresh-link)).\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_webapp_overview.png)\n\n## Creating a single-page Web application {#creating-a-single-page-web-application}\n\n1. Create a single **[!UICONTROL Page]** Web application and disable outbound transitions and transitions to the next page.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_webapp_create.png)\n\n1. Changing the page title.\n\n   This title will appear in the overview header and in the Web application overview.\n\n1. In the Web application properties, modify the rendering of your application by selecting the **[!UICONTROL Single-page Web application]** template.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_webapp_rendering.png)\n\n1. Open the **[!UICONTROL Page]** activity of your Web application and open a list (**[!UICONTROL Static element > List]**).\n1. In the **[!UICONTROL Data]** tab of your list, select the type of **[!UICONTROL Web applications]** document and the **[!UICONTROL Label]** , **[!UICONTROL Creation date]** and **[!UICONTROL Type of application]** output columns.\n1. In the **[!UICONTROL Filter]** sub-tab, create the following filter as shown below in order to display Web applications only and exclude templates from your view.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_webapp_filter.png)\n\n1. Close the configuration window of your page and click **[!UICONTROL Preview]**.\n\n   The list of Web applications available in your database is displayed.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_webapp_preview.png)\n\n## Adding a filter on a folder {#adding-a-filter-on-a-folder}\n\nIn an overview, you can choose to access data depending on its location in the Adobe Campaign tree. This is a filter on a folder. Apply the following process to add it to your overview.\n\n1. Place your cursor on the **[!UICONTROL Page]** node of your Web application and add a **[!UICONTROL Select folder]** element (**[!UICONTROL Advanced controls > Select folder]**).\n1. In the **[!UICONTROL Storage]** window which comes up, click the **[!UICONTROL Edit variables]** link.\n1. Change the variable label to suit your needs.\n1. Change the variable name with the **folder** value.\n\n   >[!NOTE]\n   >\n   >The name of the variable must match the name of the element linked to the folder (defined in the schema), i.e. **folder** in this case. You must re-use this name when you reference the table.\n\n1. Apply the **[!UICONTROL XML]** type to the variable.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_webapp_variable_xml.png)\n\n1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Refresh page]** interaction.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_webapp_variable.png)\n\n1. Place your cursor on your list, and in the **[!UICONTROL Advanced]** tab, reference the variable previously created in the **[!UICONTROL Folder filter XPath]** tab of the list. You must use the name of the element concerned by the folder link, i.e. **folder**.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_webapp_variable002.png)\n\n   >[!NOTE]\n   >\n   >At this stage, the Web application is not within its application context, the filter can therefore not be tested on the folder.\n\n## Adding a button to configure a new Web application {#adding-a-button-to-configure-a-new-web-application}\n\n1. Place your cursor on the **[!UICONTROL Page]** element and add a link (**[!UICONTROL Static elements > Link]**).\n1. Modify the link label since it will appear on the button in the overview.\n\n   In our example, the label is **New**.\n\n1. Insert the following URL in the URL field: **xtk://open/?schema=nms:webApp&form=nms:newWebApp**.\n\n   >[!NOTE]\n   >\n   >**nms:webApp** coincides with the Web application schema.\n   >\n   >**nms:newWebApp** coincides with the new Web application creation wizard.\n\n1. Choose to display the URL in the same window.\n1. Add the Web application icon in the image field: **/nms/img/webApp.png**.\n\n   This icon will appear on the **[!UICONTROL New]** button.\n\n1. Enter **button** in the **[!UICONTROL Style]** field.\n\n   This style is referred to in the **[!UICONTROL Single-page Web application]** template selected previously.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_webapp_link.png)\n\n## Adding detail to a list {#adding-detail-to-a-list}\n\nWhen you configure a list in your overview, you can choose to display additional details for each entry on your list.\n\n1. Place your cursor on the previously created list element.\n1. In the **[!UICONTROL General]** tab, select the **[!UICONTROL Columns and additional detail]** display mode in the drop-down list.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_webapp_detail.png)\n\n1. In the **[!UICONTROL Data]** tab, add the **[!UICONTROL Primary key]** , **[!UICONTROL Internal name]** and **[!UICONTROL Description]** column and select the **[!UICONTROL Hidden field]** option for each one.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_webapp_detail002.png)\n\n   This way, this information will only be visible in the detail of each entry.\n\n1. In the **[!UICONTROL Additional detail]** tab, add the following code:\n\n   ```\n   <div class=\"detailBox\">\n     <div class=\"actionBox\">\n       <span class=\"action\"><img src=\"/xtk/img/fileEdit.png\"/><a title=\"Open\" class=\"linkAction\" href=\"xtk://open/?schema=nms:webApp&form=nms:webApp&pk=\n       <%=webApp.id%>\">Open...</a></span>\n       <% \n       if( webApp.@appType == 1 ) { //survey\n       %>\n       <span class=\"action\"><img src=\"/xtk/img/report.png\"/><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reports\" class=\"linkAction\" href=\"/xtk/report.jssp?_context=selection&\n         _schema=nms:webApp&_selection=<%=webApp.@id%>\n         &__sessiontoken=<%=document.controller.getSessionToken()%>\">Reports</a></span>\n       <% \n       } \n       %>\n     </div>\n     <div>\n       Internal name: <%= webApp.@internalName %>\n     </div>\n     <%\n     if( webApp.desc != \"\" )\n     {\n     %>\n     <div>\n       Description: <%= webApp.desc %>\n     </div>\n     <% \n     } \n     %>\n   </div>\n   ```\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>JavaScript libraries take five minutes to refresh on the server. You can restart the server to avoid waiting for this delay.\n\n## Filtering and updating the list {#filtering-and-updating-the-list}\n\nIn this section, you will create a filter for displaying the overview of Web applications created by a specific operator. This filter is created with a link editor. Once you have selected an operator, refresh the list to apply your filter; this requires creating a refresh link.\n\nThese two elements will be grouped in the same container in order to be graphically grouped in the overview.\n\n1. Place your cursor on the **[!UICONTROL Page]** element and select **[!UICONTROL Container > Standard]**.\n1. Set the number of columns to **2**, so that the link editor and the link are next to each other.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_webapp_container.png)\n\n   For information on element layout, refer to [this section](about-web-forms.md).\n\n1. Apply **dottedFilter**.\n\n   This style is referred to in the **[!UICONTROL Single-page Web application]** template selected previously.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_webapp_container002.png)\n\n### Creating a filter using a link editor {#creating-a-filter-using-a-link-editor}\n\n1. Place your cursor on the container created during the previous stage and insert a link editor via the **[!UICONTROL Advanced controls]** menu.\n1. In the storage window which opens automatically, select the **[!UICONTROL Variables]** option, then click the **[!UICONTROL Edit variables]** link and create an XML variable for filtering data.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_webapp_variable003.png)\n\n1. Modify the label.\n\n   It will appear next to the **[!UICONTROL Filter]** field in the overview.\n\n1. Choose the Operator table as an application schema.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_webapp_linkeditor.png)\n\n1. Place your cursor on the list element and create a filter via the **[!UICONTROL Data > Filter]** tab:\n\n    * **Expression:** Foreign key of the 'Created by' link\n    * **Operator:** equals to\n    * **Value:** Variables (variables)\n    * **Taken into account if:** '$(var2/@id)'!=''\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_webapp_filter002.png)\n\n>[!CAUTION]\n>\n>The Web application user must be an identified operator with the appropriate Adobe Campaign rights to access the information. This type of configuration will not work for anonymous Web applications.\n\n### Creating a refresh link {#creating-a-refresh-link}\n\n1. Place the cursor on the container and insert a **[!UICONTROL Link]** via the **[!UICONTROL Static elements]** menu.\n1. Modify the label.\n1. Select **[!UICONTROL Refresh data in a list]**.\n1. Add the previously created list.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_webapp_refreshlink.png)\n\n1. Add the refresh icon on the **[!UICONTROL Image]** field: **/xtk/img/refresh.png**.\n1. Using the sort-order arrows, reorganize the various elements of your Web application as shown below.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_webapp_orderelements.png)\n\nThe Web application is now configured. You can click the **[!UICONTROL Preview]** tab to preview it.\n\n![](assets/s_ncs_configuration_webapp_result.png)\n","headers":[["title","\"Use cases","create overviews\""],["description","\"Use cases","create overviews\""],["feature","Web Apps"]],"sections":[{"section":"Use cases: create overview pages","sectionId":"63326138-cb2c-4687-8a27-6ec19a5055e9","paragraphs":["In the following example, we will create overview-type Web applications to display all the Web applications in your database.
