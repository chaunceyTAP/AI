In the **[!UICONTROL Profiles and Targets]** tab, click the **[!UICONTROL Simulations]** link, then click the **[!UICONTROL Create]** button.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_simulation_001.png)\n\n1. Save and edit the simulation which you have just created.\n1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Edit]** tab and specify the execution settings.\n\n   For more on this, refer to [Execution settings](../../interaction/using/execution-settings.md).\n\n   ![](assets/offer_simulation_003.png)\n\n   >[!NOTE]\n   >\n   >Execution settings are only available if you are using Interaction with Campaign.\n\n1. Specify the simulation scope.\n\n   For more on this, refer to [Definition of the scope](../../interaction/using/simulation-scope.md#definition-of-the-scope).\n\n   ![](assets/offer_simulation_004.png)\n\n1. Add reporting axes to enhance the **[!UICONTROL Offer distribution by rank]** report (optional).\n\n   For more on this, refer to [Adding reporting axes](../../interaction/using/simulation-scope.md#adding-reporting-axes).\n\n   ![](assets/offer_simulation_005.png)\n\n1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** to record the simulation settings.\n1. Start the simulation via the dashboard.\n\n   ![](assets/offer_simulation_006.png)\n\n1. Check the simulation result and display the analysis report.\n\n   For more on this, refer to [Simulation tracking](../../interaction/using/simulation-tracking.md).\n\n   ![](assets/offer_simulation_007.png)\n","headers":[["title","About offers simulation"],["description","About offers simulation"],["feature","Interaction, Offers"]],"sections":[{"section":"About offers simulation","sectionId":"3d339e60-9439-4b51-ba2e-15e0ad3db235","paragraphs":["The Simulation module lets you test the distribution of offers belonging to a category or an environment before sending your proposition to recipients.","Simulation takes into account the contexts and eligibility rules previously applied to offers (refer to Offer catalog overview), as well as their presentation rules (refer to Managing offer presentation).
