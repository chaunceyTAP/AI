This information will be processed by the editor and help the user to link a field of the database to the field of the form when configuring the Web application.\n\n  Example of HTML code in the template:\n\n  ```\n  \n  <input id=\"email\" type=\"email\" name=\"email\"/>\n     \n  ```\n\n  The **'type'** attribute is visible in the interface in the following form:\n\n  ![](assets/dce_sidebar_inputtypechanges.png)\n\n  The official list of 'type' attributes is available [in this website](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_type.asp).\n\n* Steps to simulating an end page with the DCE:\n\n  ![](assets/dce_enchainement.png)\n\n* Make sure that there is only one `<body> </body>` in the page.\n* When a CSS or JS file is uploaded, the images contained within the.zip file are not uploaded. The references to these images present in the CSS are therefore not updated.\n\n## Content editor supported formats {#content-editor-supported-formats}\n\nThe Digital Content Editor supports the HTML format: you can switch-over to **source** mode at any time.\n\nThe Digital Content Editor's import function works as follows with the following supported formats:\n\n* CSS: the images present in the .zip file are not imported. The references to these images in the CSS are not updated.\n* JS: the images present in the .zip file are not imported. The references to these images in the JS are not updated.\n* Iframe: the linked pages are not imported.\n* Landing pages & Web apps: if a **form** tag is missing, a warning will appear. A `<form> </form>` must always be present in the message body.\n\nThe Digital Content Editor also works with the following supported Code-pages:\n\n* iso-8859-1\n* iso-8859-2\n* utf-7\n* utf-8 (recommended when using a BOM)\n* iso-8859-15\n* us-ascii\n* shift jis\n* iso-2022-jp\n* big-5\n* euc-kr\n* utf-16\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>The HTML code page must be defined in a meta tag (HTML 4 or HTML 5) or in the BOM. If no code page is available, open the file in latin1.\n\n## HTML content statuses {#html-content-statuses}\n\nThe upper section of the editor displays messages related to the status of the content. The color codes for the messages are as follows:\n\n* **Grey message**: information message, no actions need to be carried out in the editor.\n* **Blue message**: information message related to the content being edited.\n* **Yellow message**: warning or error message requiring action on behalf of the user.\n\n### List of messages when editing a Web application {#list-of-messages-when-editing-a-web-application}\n\n* The HTML content is functional.\n* The Web application has not been published and cannot be accessed online.\n* The Web application is online, please publish again to apply any changes.\n* The page content isn't functional. It must include an HTML form (`<form>`)\n* There is n input zone(s) or buttons to configure.\n* To enable the transition to the next page, you need to link the 'Next page' action to a button or a link on the current page.\n\n### List of messages when editing a delivery {#list-of-messages-when-editing-a-delivery}\n\n* The delivery content is functional\n* There are n fields or personalization blocks to configure.\n* The delivery content is ready, please run the analysis again to apply any changes.\n* The delivery is ready to be sent.\n","headers":[["title","Content editing best practices"],["description","Content editing best practices"],["feature","Web Apps, Web Forms, Landing Pages, Email Design"]],"sections":[{"section":"Content editing best practices","sectionId":"9e82437c-33d8-4312-a270-8003d691ec09","paragraphs":["To ensure the editor's optimal operation, we recommend observing the following guidelines:","Before importing an HTML page template in Adobe Campaign, please make sure the template opens and displays correctly in the various browsers.","If the HTML page contains JavaScript scripts, they need to execute without errors outside of the editor.","When building a template, we recommend adding a 'type' attribute to <input> tags.
