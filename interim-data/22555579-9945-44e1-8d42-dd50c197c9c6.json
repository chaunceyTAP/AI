These are mainly large volume tables (possibly with linked tables) with potentially long calculations. For example, a fact table can be: the broadlog table, the purchase table, etc.\n\n* **Dimension** - Dimensions let you segment data into groups: once they have been created, the dimensions serve as analysis axes. In most cases, for a given dimension, several levels will be defined. For example, for a temporal dimension, the levels will be months, days, hours, minutes, etc. This set of levels represents the dimension hierarchy and enables various levels of data analysis.\n\n* **Binning** - For some fields, you can define binning to group values and make it easier to read information. Binning is applied to levels. We recommend that you define binning when there is a possibility of many different values.\n\n* **Measure** - The most frequent measures are sum, average, maximum, minimum, standard deviation etc. Measures can be calculated: for instance, the acceptance rate of an offer is the ratio of the number of times it was presented compared to the number of times it was accepted.\n\n## Cube workspace {#cube-workspace}\n\nCubes are stored in the **[!UICONTROL Administration > Configuration > Cubes]** node.\n\n![](assets/s_advuser_cube_node.png)\n\nThe main contexts of use for cubes are as follows:\n\n* Data exports can be carried out directly in a report, designed in the **[!UICONTROL Reports]** tab of the Adobe Campaign platform.\n\n  To do this, create a new report and select the cube you want to use.\n\n  ![](assets/cube_create_new.png)\n\n  Cubes appear like templates based on which reports are created. Once you have chosen a template, click **[!UICONTROL Create]** to configure and view the matching report.\n\n  You can adapt measures, change the display mode or configure the table, then display the report using the main button.\n\n  ![](assets/cube_display_new.png)\n\n* You can also reference a cube in the **[!UICONTROL Query]** box of a report to use its indicators, as shown below:\n\n  ![](assets/s_advuser_query_using_a_cube.png)\n\n* You can also insert a pivot table based on a cube into any page of a report.
