The email addresses to be excluded from the target are stored in an external list. In our example, only the information on email addresses is required for exclusion.\n\n1. The **New Contacts** folder selection query must enable you to load the selected profiles' email addresses, in order to enable alignment with the information in the list.\n\n   ![](assets/s_advuser_list_read_sample_0.png)\n\n1. Here, the list is stored in the **Lists** folder and its label is calculated.\n\n   ![](assets/s_advuser_list_read_sample_2.png)\n\n1. In order to exclude the email addresses of the external list from the main target, you must configure the exclusion activity and specify that the **New Contacts** folder contains the data to be kept. The joint data between this set and any other inbound set from the exclusion activity will be deleted from the target.\n\n   ![](assets/s_advuser_list_read_sample_3.png)\n\n   Exclusion rules are configured in the central section of the editing tool. Click the **[!UICONTROL Add]** button to define the type of exclusion to be applied.\n\n   You can define several exclusions depending on the number of incoming transitions of the activity.\n\n1. In the **[!UICONTROL Exclusion set]** field, select the **[!UICONTROL Read list]** activity: the data in this activity is to be excluded from the main set.\n\n   In our example, we have an exclusion on joins: the data contained in the list will be reconciled with the data of the main set via the field containing the email address. To configure the join, select **[!UICONTROL Joins]** in the **[!UICONTROL Change dimension]** field.\n\n   ![](assets/s_advuser_list_read_sample_4.png)\n\n1. Then select the field corresponding to the email address in the two sets (Source and Destination).
