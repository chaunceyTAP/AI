However, before that date, you must upgrade your Campaign environment to v7.4.1 and migrate your Technical Account to OAuth.\n\n## Create an Adobe Analytics Product profile {#analytics-product-profile}\n\nProduct Profile determines the level of access a user has on your different Analytics Components.\n\nIf you already have an Analytics Product Profile, you should still create a new Adobe Analytics product profile used exclusively for the Analytics connector. This will ensure that your Product profile is set with the correct permissions for this integration. \n\nFor more information on Product profiles, refer to the [Admin console documentation](https://helpx.adobe.com/mt/enterprise/admin-guide.html).\n\n1. From the [Admin console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/), select your Adobe Analytics **[!UICONTROL Product]**.\n\n    ![](assets/do-not-localize/triggers_1.png)\n\n1. Click **[!UICONTROL New Profile]**.\n\n    ![](assets/do-not-localize/triggers_2.png)\n\n1. Add a **[!UICONTROL Product profile name]**, we suggest using the following syntax: `reserved_campaign_classic_<Company Name>`. Then, click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.\n   \n   This **[!UICONTROL Product profile]** should be used exclusively for the Analytics Connector to prevent misconfiguration errors.\n\n1. Open your newly created **[!UICONTROL Product profile]** and select the **[!UICONTROL Permissions]** tab.\n\n    ![](assets/do-not-localize/triggers_3.png)\n\n1. Configure the different capabilities clicking **[!UICONTROL Edit]** and select the permissions to assign to your **[!UICONTROL Product profile]** by clicking the plus (+) icon. \n\n   For more information on how to manage permissions, refer to the [Admin console documentation](https://helpx.adobe.com/mt/enterprise/using/manage-permissions-and-roles.html).\n\n1. For the **[!UICONTROL Report Suites]** capability, add the **[!UICONTROL Report Suites]** you need to use later on.\n      \n      If you don't have any report suites, you can create it following [these steps](../../integrations/using/gs-aa.md).\n\n    ![](assets/do-not-localize/triggers_4.png)\n\n1. For the **[!UICONTROL Metrics]** capability, add the **[!UICONTROL Metrics]** you will need to configure later on. \n\n    If needed, you can switch on the Auto-include option which will add every permissions item into the included list and will automatically add new permission items. \n\n    ![](assets/do-not-localize/triggers_13.png)\n\n1. For the **[!UICONTROL Dimensions]** capability, add the **[!UICONTROL Dimensions]** needed for future configuration. \n\n    Ensure the chosen Dimensions match those to be configured in the External Account and align with the corresponding eVars number from Adobe Analytics.\n\n1. For the **[!UICONTROL Report Suite Tools]** capability, add the following permissions:\n\n   * **[!UICONTROL Report suite Mgmt]**\n   * **[!UICONTROL Conversion variables]**\n   * **[!UICONTROL Success events]**\n   * **[!UICONTROL Custom data Warehouse report]**\n   * **[!UICONTROL Data sources manager]**\n   * **[!UICONTROL Classifications]**\n\n1. For the **[!UICONTROL Analytics Tools]** capability, add the following permissions:\n\n   * **[!UICONTROL Code Manager - Web services]**\n   * **[!UICONTROL Logs - Web services]**\n   * **[!UICONTROL Web services]**\n   * **[!UICONTROL Web service access]**\n   * **[!UICONTROL Calculated metric creation]**\n   * **[!UICONTROL Segment creation]**\n\nYour Product profile is now configured.
