You must also refer to [this page](about-migration.md) for more guidance.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>In this document, commands are given as samples. They can vary depending on your configuration.\n\n1. Check your Adobe Campaign version: before migrating, install the latest build of the current version that you are using.\n1. Back up your data.\n1. Check your environment: you cannot change your database engine system (DBMS). For instance, you cannot switch from a PostgreSQL engine to an Oracle engine. However, you can switch to the latest versiuon of your database engine. Note that it is not possible to go from a non-Unicode database to a Unicode database.\n\n## Migration steps {#migration-steps}\n\nThe migration procedure must be carried out on **all** servers and in a particular order.\n\n* In the case of a **standalone platform** (single machine mode), the application is migrated in its entirety.\n* In the case of a **standard platform** (enterprise), the migration steps are as follows:\n\n    1. Migrate the marketing server. \n    1. Migrate the mail server (mta).\n    1. Migrate the redirection and tracking servers (Apache / IIS).\n\n* In the case of a **Cloud Messaging platform**, the execution servers are hosted at Adobe Campaign. Please contact Adobe Campaign to coordinate migration between different servers.\n* In the case of a **Power Booster or Power Cluster platform**, the migration steps are as follows:\n\n    1. Migrate the redirection and tracking servers (Apache / IIS).\n    1. Migrate the Power Booster/Cluster servers.\n    1. Migrate the marketing server.\n\n## User passwords {#user-passwords}\n\nIn v7, **internal** and **admin** operator connection must be secured by a password. We strongly recommend assigning passwords to these accounts and all operator accounts, **before migration**. If you have not specified a password for **internal**, you will not be able to connect. To assign a password to **internal**, enter the following command:\n\n```\nnlserver config -internalpassword\n```\n\n>[!CAUTION]\n>\n>The **internal** password must be identical for all the tracking servers. For more information, refer to the [Internal identifier](../../installation/using/configuring-campaign-server.md#internal-identifier) and [Permissions](../../platform/using/access-management.md) sections.\n","headers":[["title","Before starting migration"],["description","Before starting migration"],["feature","Upgrade"],["topic-tags","migration-procedure"]],"sections":[{"section":"Prerequisites","sectionId":"b05ac29f-da14-4fdd-be9a-08870b9d344b","paragraphs":["This page lists specific steps to perform before starting the migration process.
