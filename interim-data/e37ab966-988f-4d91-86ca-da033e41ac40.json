Data management activities let you implement consistent management of all communications with a contact using information related to their contracts, subscriptions, reactivity to deliveries, etc. Data Management lets you track the data life cycle during segmentation operations, in particular:\n\n* Simplifying and optimizing targeting processes, by including data that is not modeled in the datamart (creating new tables: local extension to each targeting workflow depending on configuration).\n* Keeping and conveying buffer calculations, especially during target construction phases or for database administration.\n* Accessing external bases (optional): heterogeneous databases taken into account during the targeting process.\n\n[Click here to learn more](../../workflow/using/targeting-data.md#data-management) and be able to design complex target and work on your data combining data management workflow activities.\n\n## Can I automate personalized messages sending? {#can-i-automate-personalized-messages-sending-}\n\nRead out [this use case](../../workflow/using/enriching-data.md) to send personalized messages to people depending on their highest scores of a competition.\n\n## How can I split an audience in subsets with a workflow? {#how-can-i-split-an-audience-in-subsets-with-a-workflow-}\n\nLearn how to split a target into several subsets [in this section](../../workflow/using/split.md).\n\n## How can I update recipient data from an external file? {#how-can-i-update-recipient-data-from-an-external-file-}\n\nYou can modify certain fields in a Campaign table with values from an external text file.\n\n[Click here to learn how](../../platform/using/import-operations-samples.md#example--enrich-the-values-with-those-of-an-external-file).\n\n## How can I identify and target new recipients? {#how-can-i-identify-and-target-new-recipients-}\n\n[This use case](../../workflow/using/using-aggregates.md) will learn you how to use aggregates to automatically identify last recipients added in the database and send them a welcome message.\n","headers":[["title","Workflows FAQ"],["description","Campaign Classic FAQ"],["feature","Troubleshooting, Workflows"],["topic-tags","starting-with-adobe-campaign"]],"sections":[{"section":"Workflows FAQ","sectionId":"e9dfe9a7-30a9-4aeb-b0d0-700e0c62a9cf","paragraphs":["Learn how to orchestrate processes and tasks with Adobe Campaign workflows."]},{"section":"What are the key steps to create a workflow?","sectionId":"cf332b4e-eac5-4d5a-810c-eca1065352f7","paragraphs":["Click here to learn how to create your first workflow: learn concepts and best practices to build workflows in Campaign."]},{"section":"How can I import data in Campaign?","sectionId":"0b006ebb-ec83-4b7f-bdf2-c62b1584cbcf","paragraphs":["Learn best practices to import data in this section."]},{"section":"Can I monitor workflow execution?","sectionId":"95c4562c-cafc-47bc-8925-1edb6e071130","paragraphs":["Understand how to monitor Campaign workflow execution in this page."]},{"section":"How can I update Campaign data with a workflow?","sectionId":"2cbd7814-6ef2-4356-8c16-482004d6e13a","paragraphs":["You can perform massive update, merge and insert on the data in the database.","Click here to learn more."]},{"section":"How can I leverage data management capabilities?","sectionId":"efcedce3-a6ec-4563-9802-deebbb19dc46","paragraphs":["In Adobe Campaign, you can leverage a set of activities for solving complex targeting issues by offering more efficient and flexible tools.
