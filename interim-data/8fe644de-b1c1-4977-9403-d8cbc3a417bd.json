You can add filtering rules by adding typologies or typology rules.\n\n## Example: Inserting an offer via a delivery outline {#example--inserting-an-offer-via-a-delivery-outline}\n\nThe **delivery outline** activity, available in the campaign workflows, lets you present offers that are referenced in a delivery outline from the current campaign in progress.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>The **Interaction** package must be installed.\n\n1.
