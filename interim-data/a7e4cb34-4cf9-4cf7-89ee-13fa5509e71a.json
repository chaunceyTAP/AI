Whenever a new version of the client console is available, users are invited to download it when launching their client console.\n\nTo do this, you must:\n\n1. Select the package that contains the console installation program.\n\n   This file is called `setup-client-7.X.XXXX.exe`, where `X` is the sub-version of Adobe Campaign and `XXXX` is the build number.\n\n1. Copy and paste this package into the Adobe Campaign installation folder (on the marketing server for hybrid installations), under **/datakit/nl/eng/jsp**.\n1. Start Adobe Campaign server.\n\nCampaign users can then download the console installation program via a web browser thanks to the following URL:\n\n```\nhttps://<your Adobe Campaign server>:>port number>/nl/jsp/logon.jsp\n```\n\nThis page requires a login and password defined in the application.\n\nLearn how to install the console [in this section](../../installation/using/installing-the-client-console.md).\n\n## Propose end users to upgrade their client console\n\nOnce the console is available in Campaign server folder, users are invited to download the latest client console version in a dedicated the prompt window. Adobe recommends leaving the option **[!UICONTROL No longer ask this question]** unselected to make sure that all users are alerted when a new version of the console is available.  \n\nIf you select this option and choose not to download the latest version, no other user will be informed of new available versions.\n\nIn case the option was selected, you can reset this prompt. Only system administrators comfortable with editing Windows Registry should make these changes:\n\n1. Open Registry Editor using the **regedit** command from the **[!UICONTROL Start > Run]** menu.\n1. Search for the node and expand it.\n\n   ```\n   \\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Neolane\\NL_6\\nlclient\n   ```\n\n1. Delete the **confAdvisedUpgrade** entry and close Registry Editor.\n","headers":[["title","Client console availability for Windows"],["description","Client console availability for Windows"],["feature","Installation, Upgrade"],["topic-tags","installing-campaign-in-windows-"]],"sections":[{"section":"Client console availability for Windows","sectionId":"1bde6814-f8e3-43bf-8c29-0bc87b0cf74b","paragraphs":["For Adobe Campaign users to be able to log on to the instance you have created and configured, they need to use the client console."]},{"section":"Make the client console available","sectionId":"25d169ee-3a1b-47be-8168-cbb8f7cee196","paragraphs":["When the computer used to start an Adobe Campaign application server (nlserver web) receives user connections from the client console, you can configure it to make the setup program for the Adobe Campaign rich client available via an HTML interface.
