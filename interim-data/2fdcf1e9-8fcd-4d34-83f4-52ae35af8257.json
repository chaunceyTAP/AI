Adobe also highly recommends to use the **same product build**. Learn how to check your Campaign Client and Server versions in [this section](../../platform/using/launching-adobe-campaign.md#getting-your-campaign-version).\n>\n>* Access to the installation folder in which the console is installed should be limited to the intended user only, ensuring that write permissions are restricted accordingly.\n\n\n\n## Microsoft Edge Webview2 runtime installation {#webview}\n\nFrom Campaign Classic 7.3 build version, installation of Microsoft Edge Webview 2 runtime is required for any console installation.\n\nWeb View is installed by default as part of Windows 11 operating system. If it is not already present on your system, Campaign Classic Console Installer will prompt you to download it from [Microsoft Developer website](https://www.adobe.com/go/acc-ms-webview2-runtime-download). Note that the download link does not work on the Internet Explorer 11 browser as Microsoft has deprecated its support. Make sure you use a different browser to access the link.\n\n## Adobe Hosted implementations {#hosted-customers}\n\nAs a hosted customer, you have two options to install or update your client console(s):\n\n1. Adobe can deploy directly. Once the console is updated, users will be prompted to download the latest client console version in a pop-up window. \n\n1. You can download to your client console(s) from [Software Distribution](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/campaign.html) \n\n   **Users will require Admin access to complete the update. If the users do not have admin rights, a system administrator will need to deploy to all client consoles**\n\n## Hybrid & On-premise implementations {#hybrid-onprem-customers}\n\nFor Adobe Campaign users to be able to log on to the instance you have created and configured, they need to use the client console.\n\n### Making the console available to users {#make-console-available}\n \nWhen the computer used to start an Adobe Campaign application server (nlserver web) receives user connections from the client console, you can configure it to make the setup program for the Adobe Campaign rich client available via an HTML interface. Whenever a new version of the client console is available, users are invited to download it when launching their client console.\n\nTo do this, you must:\n\n1. Select the package that contains the console installation program.\n\n     This file is called setup-client-7.X.XXXX.exe, where X is the sub-version of Adobe Campaign and XXXX is the build number.\n\n1. Copy and paste this package into the Adobe Campaign installation folder (on the marketing server for hybrid installations), under /datakit/nl/eng/jsp.\n\n1. Start Adobe Campaign server.\n\n\n### No longer ask this question option\n\nAdobe recommends leaving the option **[!UICONTROL No longer ask this question]** unselected to make sure that all users are alerted when a new version of the console is available.  If this option is selected the user will not be informed of new available versions.\n\nIf **[!UICONTROL No longer ask this question]**  has been selected, you can reset this prompt. Only system administrators comfortable with editing Windows Registry should make these changes:\n\n1. Open Registry Editor using the **regedit** command from the **[!UICONTROL Start > Run]** menu.\n\n1. Search for the node and expand it.\n\n   ```\n   \\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Neolane\\NL_6\\nlclient\n   ```\n\n1. Delete the **confAdvisedUpgrade** entry and close Registry Editor.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>If you are applying an updated console to an existing implementation, the users will automatically receive a prompt to update their client console. If you are implementing Campaign for the first time, users will need to download the console. Please see below for details on both options\n\n### Update the console for existing implementation{#update-the-client-console}\n\nOnce the console is available in the Campaign server folder, users will be prompted to download the latest client console version in a pop-up window. \n   \n   **Users will require admin access to complete the update. If the users do not have admin rights, a system administrator will need to deploy to all client consoles**\n\n\n### Download the console for new implementation{#download-the-client-console}\n\nUsers should now download and install the console by following the steps below:\n\n1. Open a web browser and download the console from the following address:\n\n   `https://<your adobe campaign server>:<port number>/nl/jsp/logon.jsp`.\n\n1. In the identification window, enter your login and password. \n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_install_setup_download01.png)\n\n   If necessary, use the credentials of the internal account defined during instance creation.\n\n1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Download]** link on the installation page.\n1. Download and save the client setup file.\n1. Execute the downloaded file on a computer on Windows: The installation starts up. The default installation path of the client console is **$PROGRAMFILES$/Adobe/Adobe Campaign Classic vX Client**, where 'X' is '6' or '7', according to your Adobe Campaign version.\n\n### Create the connection - first time users only{#create-the-connection}\n\nOnce the client console is installed, follow the steps below to create the connection to the application server:\n\n1. Start the console from the Windows **[!UICONTROL Start]** menu, in the **Adobe Campaign** program group.\n\n1. Click the link in the top right-hand corner of the credentials fields to access the connection configuration window.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_install_define_connection_01.png)\n\n1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add > Connection]** and enter the label and URL of the Adobe Campaign application server.\n\n   ![](assets/s_ncs_install_define_connection_02.png)\n\n1. Specify a connection to your Adobe Campaign application server via a URL. Use either a DNS or an alias of the machine, or your IP address.\n\n   For example, you can use the `https://<machine>.<domain>.com` type URL.\n\n1. If Adobe IMS is configured for your organization, check the option **[!UICONTROL Connect with an Adobe ID]** \n\n1. Click **[!UICONTROL Ok]** to save your settings.\n\nYou can add as many connections as needed to connect to your test, stage and production environments for example.\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>The **[!UICONTROL Add]** button lets you create **[!UICONTROL folders]** to organize all your connections. Simply drag and drop each connection into a folder.\n\n### Log on to Adobe Campaign \n\nTo log on to an existing instance, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Start the console from the Windows **[!UICONTROL Start]** menu, in the **Adobe Campaign** program group.\n\n1. Click the link in the top right-hand corner of the credentials fields to access the connection configuration window.\n\n1. Select the Campaign instance you need to log in to.\n\n1. Click **[!UICONTROL Ok]**\n\n1. Enter your user login credentials and click **[!UICONTROL Log in]**\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>\n>For campaign classic 7.3 build versions, Adobe Campaign client console may ask for proxy credentials two times during proxy authentication. This is due to the fact that Microsoft Edge Webview2 does not save proxy credentials in the cache/password store unlike Internet Explorer.\n\n**Related topics**\n\n* [Creating an instance and logging on](../../installation/using/creating-an-instance-and-logging-on.md).\n* [Compatibility matrix](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/compatibility-matrix.html) \n\n## Tutorial video\n\nThis video shows how to install and setup the Adobe Campaign Client.\n\n>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/35124?quality=12)\n\nAdditional Campaign Classic how-to videos are available [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic-learn/tutorials/overview.html).\n","headers":[["title","Installing the client console"],["description","Learn how to install the client console"],["feature","Installation, Upgrade"],["topic-tags","installing-campaign-in-windows-"]],"sections":[{"section":"Install & Update the Campaign client console","sectionId":"48294ff8-5679-4da0-ad4a-8d25bfab466f","paragraphs":["Campaign Client Console is a rich client which enables you to connect to your Campaign application server(s).","Before starting to install the Client Console, you need to:","Check your system and tools compatibility with Adobe Campaign in the Compatibility matrix\nGet your Campaign server URL\nGet your user credentials\nHave Microsft Edge Webview2 runtime installed on your system (from Campaign Classic 7.3 build version).
