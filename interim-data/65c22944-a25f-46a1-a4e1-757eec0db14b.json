The two queries target the recipients. The results are therefore based on the same table.\n\n1. Insert a **[!UICONTROL Union]** -type activity straight after the two queries and before an update-type activity of the list then open it.\n1. You may enter a label.\n1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Keys only]** reconciliation method since, in this example, the population resulting from queries contains consistent data.\n1. If you have added additional data for the queries, you can decide to keep only the data that is shared.\n1. If you wish to limit the size of the final population, check the **[!UICONTROL Limit size of generated population]** box.\n\n   Specify this final number by entering the maximum number of recipients and by selecting the query whose population will take priority.\n\n1. Approve the union activity then configure the list update activity (see [List update](list-update.md)). \n1. Start the workflow. The number of results is displayed and the list defined in the list update activity is created or updated.
