Follow the steps below to configure access to Netezza.\n\n1. Install and configure [Netezza drivers](#netezza-config)\n1. Configure the Netezza [external account](#netezza-external) in Campaign\n\n## Netezza configuration {#netezza-config}\n\nConnecting to a Netezza external database in FDA requires additional configurations below on the Adobe Campaign server:\n\n1. Install the ODBC drivers for Netezza, according to the operating system that you use:\n\n    * **nz-linuxclient-v7.2.0.0.tar.gz** for Linux. Select the folder that corresponds to your operating system (linux or linux64) and start the unpack command. You can leave the installation to be carried out in the repository that is suggested by default: \"/usr/local/nz\".\n    * **nz-winclient-v7.2.0.0.zip** for Windows. Unzip the file and start the executable script that corresponds to your operating system: nzodbcsetup.exe or nzodbcsetup64.exe. Follow the wizard instructions to finish installing the drivers.\n\n1. Configure the ODBC driver. The configuration can be carried out in the standard files: **/etc/odbc.ini** for general parameters and **/etc/odbcinst.ini** for declaring drivers.\n\n    * **/etc/odbc.ini**\n\n      ```\n      [ODBC]\n      InstallDir=/etc/\n      ```\n\n      \"InstallDir\" corresponds to the location of the odbcinst.ini file.\n\n    * **/etc/odbcinst.ini**\n\n      ```\n      [ODBC Drivers]\n      NetezzaSQL = Installed\n\n      [NetezzaSQL]\n      Driver           = /usr/local/nz/lib/libnzsqlodbc3.so\n      Setup            = /usr/local/nz/lib/libnzsqlodbc3.so\n      APILevel         = 1\n      ConnectFunctions = YYN\n      Description      = Netezza ODBC driver\n      DriverODBCVer    = 03.51\n      DebugLogging     = false\n      LogPath          = /tmp\n      UnicodeTranslationOption = utf8\n      CharacterTranslationOption = all\n      PreFetch         = 256\n      Socket           = 16384\n      ```\n\n1.
