All operators should implement [Adobe Identity Management System (IMS)](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/identity.html){target=\"_blank\"} to connect to Campaign.\n\nLearn more about this migration in [this page](ac-ims.md).\n\n## What changed? {#move-to-ims-changes}\n\nWith Campaign Classic, all regular users can already connect to the Adobe Campaign client console using their Adobe ID, through Adobe Identity Management System (IMS). However, user/password connections are still available. This will no longer be permitted with Campaign v8.\n\nIn addition, as part of the effort to reinforce security and authentication process, Adobe Campaign client application now calls Campaign APIs directly using the IMS technical account token. Migration for technical operators is detailed in a dedicated article, available in [this page](ims-migration.md).\n\nThis change is already applicable in Campaign Classic v7, and will be **mandatory** to move to Campaign v8. \n\nAdobe supports you in this migration effort. You can find detailed context and step by step guidelines in the below article.\n\n## Are you impacted?{#migrate-ims-impacts}\n\nThis procedure applies to all Campaign users which are not already connecting to Campaign with their Adobe ID.\n\nIf operators in your organization are connecting to Campaign client console using their login/password (aka. native authentication), you are impacted, and should migrate these operator(s) to Adobe IMS as detailed below.\n\nMigration to [Adobe Identity Management System (IMS)](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/identity.html){target=\"_blank\"} is a security imperative to make your environments secure and standardized, as most of the other Adobe Experience Cloud solutions and apps are already on IMS.\n\nThis change is applicable starting Campaign Classic v7.4.1 (and latest [IMS migration compatible versions](ac-ims.md#ims-versions)) and is **mandatory** to move to Adobe Campaign v8.\n\n\n## How to migrate Hosted and Managed Services environments? {#ims-migration-procedure}\n\n### Prerequisites {#ims-migration-prerequisites}\n\nBefore starting the migration process, you must reach out to your Adobe Transition Manager (for Managed Services customers), or to Adobe Customer Care (for other hosted customers), so that Adobe technical teams can migrate your existing Operator groups and Named rights to Adobe Identity Management System (IMS).\n\n### Key steps {#ims-migration-steps}\n\nKey steps for this migration are listed below: \n\n1. Adobe upgrades your environments to Campaign v7.4.1 (or an [IMS migration compatible version](ac-ims.md#ims-versions)).\n1. After the upgrade, you can still create new users with both methods, as native user or with IMS.\n1. Your internal Campaign Administrator must add unique emails to all native users on the Campaign client console, and confirm to your Adobe representative / Customer Care once this is done.  This step is detailed in [this section](#ims-migration-id).\n1. Work with your Adobe representative / Customer Care to secure a date for Adobe to run automated migration for your non-technical users (operators) and product profiles. This step requires an hour window with no downtime to any of your services.\n1. Your internal Campaign Administrator validates these changes, and provides sign-off. After this migration, you must no longer create any further operator authenticating with his login and password.\n\nYou can also migrate your technical operator(s) to Adobe Developer Console as detailed in [this technote](ims-migration.md). \n\nOnce this migration is completed, confirm to your Adobe Transition Manager (for Managed Services users), or to Adobe Customer care (for Hosted customers). Adobe then marks the migration as complete. Your environment is then secured and standardized. \n\n\n## How to migrate Hybrid and On-premise environments? {#ims-migration-procedure-on-prem}\n\nKey steps for this migration are listed below: \n\n1. Upgrade your environments to Campaign v7.4.1 (or an [IMS migration compatible version](#ims-versions)).\n1. After the upgrade, you can still create new users with both methods, as native user or with IMS.\n1. Your internal Campaign Administrator must configure Adobe IMS as detailed in [this section](../../integrations/using/configuring-ims.md).\n1. Then add unique emails to all native users on the Campaign client console. This step is detailed in [this section](#ims-migration-id).\n1. Create users and product profiles in Adobe Admin Console as detailed in [Campaign v8 documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/admin/permissions/manage-permissions.html){target=\"_blank\"}.\n1. Enable the **Connect with Adobe ID** option for all operators.\n1. Implement Adobe IMS for your connection as detailed in [this page](../../integrations/using/implementing-ims.md).\n\nYou can also migrate your technical operator(s) to Adobe Developer Console as detailed in [this technote](ims-migration.md). \n\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions {#ims-migration-faq}\n\n### How to create users after migration? {#ims-migration-native}\n\nAdobe recommends to create only IMS users after upgrading to Campaign Classic v7.4.1 (or an [IMS migration compatible version](#ims-versions)).\nStarting Campaign v7.4.1, you can prevent native operators creation by updating your instance configuration as detailed in [this page](impact-ims-migration.md).\n\nAs a Campaign Administrator, you can grant permissions to the users of your organization through Adobe Admin Console and Campaign Client Console. Users log on to Adobe Campaign with their Adobe ID. Learn how to set up permissions with IMS in [Campaign v8 documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/admin/permissions/gs-permissions.html){target=\"_blank\"}. \n\n### How to add emails for current native users? {#ims-migration-id}\n\nAs a Campaign Administrator, you must add email IDs to all native users from the client console. To perform this, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Connect to the client console and browse to **Administration > Access Management > Operators**.\n1. Select the operator to update in the operator list.\n1. Enter the email of the operator in the **Contact points** section of the operator form.\n1. Save your changes.\n\n<!--You can also import a CSV file to update all your operator profiles with their email.-->\n\n\n### How to log in to Campaign via IMS? {#ims-migration-log}\n\nLearn how to connect to Campaign with your Adobe ID in [this section](../../integrations/using/implementing-ims.md).\n\n### Will there be a downtime during this migration? {#ims-migration-downtime}\n\nFor Hosted and Managed Services customers, to finalize the migration (migrate users and product profiles), Adobe requires one hour window with no downtime to any of your instances (workflows, etc).\n\nDuring this timeframe, all Campaign users need to log off, and log back with their Adobe ID once the migration to IMS is finalized.\n\nAdobe strongly recommends all users should be logged off during the migration window.\n\n### Users in my organization are already using IMS, do I still need to perform IMS migration?{#ims-migration-needed}\n\nThere are 2 aspects in this migration: end-users migration (plus product profiles) and technical users migration (used in APIs in your custom code).\n\nIf all your users (Campaign operators) are on IMS, you will still need to contact your Adobe Representative/Customer Support to plan Product Profiles Migration. You will also need to migrate Technical users you might have used in custom code. Learn more in [this page](ims-migration.md).\n\n### How to view your Operators' authentication type?\n\nLearn how to view your Operators' authentication type in Campaign:\n\n1. From the **Explorer**, access **Administration** `>` **Access Management** `>` **Operators**.\n\n1. Right-click the header row and select the **Configure list** menu.\n\n    ![](assets/ims_2.png)\n\n1. Add **Account Disabled** and **Authentication Type** as **Output columns**.\n\n    ![](assets/ims_1.png)\n\nYou can now see the list of your **Operators** and their **Authentication Type**.\n\n![](assets/ims_3.png)\n\n\n>[!MORELIKETHIS]\n>\n>* [Migration of technical users to Adobe Developer console](ims-migration.md)\n>* [Adobe Campaign Classic v7 release notes](../../rn/using/latest-release.md)\n>* [What is Adobe Identity Management System (IMS)](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/identity.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n","headers":[["title","Migrate Campaign operators to Adobe Identity Management System (IMS)"],["description","Learn how to migrate Campaign operators to Adobe Identity Management System (IMS)"]],"sections":[{"section":"Migrate Campaign operators to Adobe Identity Management System (IMS)","sectionId":"b05b60e2-c5ab-4d88-b9cd-b8e4c68e4d18","paragraphs":["As part of the effort to reinforce security and authentication process, Adobe Campaign highly recommends to migrate end user authentication mode from the login/password native authentication to Adobe Identity Management System (IMS).
